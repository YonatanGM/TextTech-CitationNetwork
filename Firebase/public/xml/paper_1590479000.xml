Most of theses companies are currently selecting FlOSS projects using ad-hoc techniques. However, in the last couple of years, two methodologies for assessing FlOSS project have emerge, namely QSOS and OpenBRR. The objective of this work is, through a detailed and rigorous assessment methodology comparison, to allow companies to have a better understanding of these two assessment methodologies content and limitation. This work compares both methodologies on several aspects, among others, their overall approaches, their scoring procedures and their evaluation criteria.</abstract></paper>

Experience in using the method on an EU project, Multimedia Broker, is reported. Quantitative data on requirements sessions is analysed to assess user participation and quality of requirements captured. The method worked well but there were problems in the use of design rationale and control of turn taking in RE sessions. Lessons learned in using the method are summarised and future improvements for the method are discussed.</abstract></paper>

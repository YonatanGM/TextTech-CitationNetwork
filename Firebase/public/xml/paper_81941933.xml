In terms of definition, we believe that there is no substantial difference between Alter’s work system construct and IT artifact. However, when it comes to enhancing the relevance of and guiding the diversity in IT research, Alter’s boundary based approach may be less powerful than a core, IT-artifact based approach. Alter’s focus on systems, nonetheless, has it merits and therefore we suggest a possible convergence of Alter and Benbasat and Zmud’s constructs.</abstract></paper>

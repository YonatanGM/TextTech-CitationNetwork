The paper presents a PVM extension that enables such clustered machines hidden from the Internet to take part in a PVM computation as hosts. This way, programmers can exploit low-cost, networked computing resources widely available within departmental organizations in a well-known programming environment, such as PVM, without having to adapt their large-scale applications to new grid programming environments.</abstract></paper>

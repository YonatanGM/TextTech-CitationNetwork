As a basis for the paper, we present a requirements model, in the form of a CPN, which describes a new bank work process that must be supported by the new system. This model has been used to specify, validate, and elicit user requirements. The contribution of this paper is to describe two translation steps that go from the requirements CPN to an implementation of the new system. In the first translation step, a workflow model is derived from the requirements model. This model is represented in terms of a so-called Colored Workflow Net (CWN), which is a generalization of the classical workflow nets to CPN. In the second translation step, the CWN is translated into implementation code. The target implementation language is BPEL4WS deployed in the context of IBM WebSphere. A semi-automatic translation of the workflow model to BPEL4WS is possible because of the structural requirements imposed on CWNs.</abstract></paper>

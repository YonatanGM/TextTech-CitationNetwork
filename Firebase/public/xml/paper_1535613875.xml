A conceptual framework for HMI is presented. It characterizes computer-supported work on three levels: on the first two levels in terms of co-operating roles played by human role players and in terms of functions which may be performed by persons or machines as actors. The dynamics are treated on a third level, called the action level.</abstract></paper>

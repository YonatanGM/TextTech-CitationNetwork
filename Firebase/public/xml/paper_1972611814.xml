But the calculus is at once intuitively simple, yet deceptively subtle, and previous theoretical analyses have been frustratingly complex: no analysis has revealed and explained in simple terms the connection between the subleties of the calculus and the imperative features it builds on. We present a novel approach for proving safety and correctness of a simplified version of the region calculus. We give a stratified operational semantics, composed of a highlevel semantics dealing with the conceptual difficulties of effect annotations, and a low-level one with explicit operations on a region-indexed store. The main results of the paper are a proof simpler than previous ones, and a modular approach to type safety and correctness. The flexibility of this approach is demonstrated by the simplicity of the extension to the full calculus with type and region polymorphism.</abstract></paper>

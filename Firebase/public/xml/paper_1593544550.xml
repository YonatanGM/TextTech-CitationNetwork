The model was tested using longitudinal data gathered from 394 end users over a one-year interval. Significant relationships were found between computer self-efficacy and outcome expectations, and between self-efficacy and affect and anxiety and use. Performance outcomes were found to influence affect and use, while affect was significantly related to use. Overall, the findings provide strong confirmation that both self-efficacy and outcome expectations impact on an individualu0027s affective and behavioral reactions to information technology.</abstract></paper>

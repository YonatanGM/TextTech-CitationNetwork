This paper examines the extent to which research over the past decade has addressed those issues important to practitioners. A list of 26 key issues is used to categorize 858 articles published in four major IS outlets. The amount of research on each issue is then compared with the importance rating of the issue by practitioners over the decade 1977â€“1986. The study reveals a definite gap between what the IS executives consider important and what is being researched. It also demonstrates that IS researchers tend to concentrate on narrow technical issues rather than broad managerial issues. The implications of this study strongly suggest that IS researchers should pay greater attention to the concerns of practicing managers.</abstract></paper>

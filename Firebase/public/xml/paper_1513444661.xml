In a previous work [1], we proposed an algorithmic approach based on constructing a symbolic representation of the set of reachable configurations of a system by means of a class of regular expressions (SREs). The construction of such a representation consists of an iterative computation with an acceleration technique which enhances the chance of convergence. This technique is based on the analysis of the effect of iterating control loops. In the work we present here, we experiment our approach and show how it can be effectively applied. For that, we developed a tool prototype based on the results in [1]. Using this tool, we provide an automatic verification of (the parameterized version of) the Bounded Retransmission Protocol.</abstract></paper>

Business partners must agree on a shared subset and adapt their application interfaces accordingly. Small and me- dium enterprises (SMEs) cannot perform this task. UN/CEFACTu0027s Modeling Methodology (UMM) provides a methodology to define unambiguous business collaborations allowing software vendors to integrate corresponding APIs into their business software. Business collaborations depend on their business con- text, i.e. parameters describing the business environment. Instead of developing different models for each specific business environment, we need a single model for a specific business goal clearly specifying the context variations. In this paper we extend UMM to show how a generic business collaboration is adapted to different business contexts. This is demonstrated by a case study on ordering/selling books as well as tourism products.</abstract></paper>

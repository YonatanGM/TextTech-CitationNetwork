The form data model is selected as the basis for the user interface. The idea of query-by-example is applied to forms. A precise semantics definition of the language is given. FOBE has a predetermined structure. It combines the advantages of procedural and nonprocedural languages. We believe that it is user-friendly and sufficiently powerful for office environments.</abstract></paper>

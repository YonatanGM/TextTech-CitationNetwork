In this background, the workflow version control plays an importantrole for the change management of business processes. To better handle theversions of evolving workflow process definitions, a new versioning method isintroduced in this paper. To capture the dynamics of the workflow evolvement,we propose a novel version preserving directed graph model to represent therun time evolvement of a workflow process, and devise a series of modificationoperations to characterise workflow updating on the fly. The extraction ofworkflow versions from a version preserving graph is also discussed with twodifferent extraction strategies. Particularly, our method allows the execution ofmultiple workflow instances of different versions within a single graph, andsupports the evolvements initiated by temporary changes.</abstract></paper>

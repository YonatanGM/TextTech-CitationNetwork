The previous two workshops were held with ECOOP’96 in Linz, Austria, and with ECOOP’97 in Jyv.askyl. a, Finland. WCOP’96 had focussed on the principal idea of software components and worked towards definitions of terms. In particular, a high-level definition of what a software component is was formed. WCOP’97 concentrated on compositional aspects, architecture and gluing, substitutability, interface evolution, and non-functional requirements. WCOP’98 had a closer look at issues arising in industrial practice and developed a major focus on the issues of adaptation. Quality attributes (as non-functional requirements are preferably now called) and component frameworks featured as well, although much less than was hoped by the workshop organisers.</abstract></paper>

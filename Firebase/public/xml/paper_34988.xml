We have concentrated our research on optimizing the portion of the PCCA manufacturing process performed by high-speed placement machines (chip shooters). A crucial factor affecting the throughput of a chip shooter is the assignment of components to the feeder slots. Genetic algorithms were employed to find a near optimal assignment of the feeder carriage. Results for various genetic operators in this problem domain are presented.

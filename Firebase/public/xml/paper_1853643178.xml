The tests can be generated at database design time and are to be applied when updates to the database are issued. A significant feature is that the tests are to be applied before the update is made. The basic method is to assert a constraint for the current state of the database, express the new state in terms of both the old state and the general form of the update, deny that the constraint holds in the new state, and attempt to obtain a contradiction. When no contradiction is found, tests are to be extracted from the formulas generated and represent, in effect, a set of reasons why a contradiction could not be found, i.e., what extra conditions must be verified to guarantee the constraint in the new state. Some general results are given and open problems about the method are discussed.</abstract></paper>

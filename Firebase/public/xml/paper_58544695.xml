Although the problems of designing and implementing company-wide integrated information systems are primarily managerial rater than technical, little is known about the role of management practices in MIS development or the most appropriate areas or avenues for top management involvement. Through field studies of thirty-three organizations, the author explores the ways in which these firms have managed their information systems operations and how this has influenced their success. This article develops a framework for assessing top managementu0027s role in providing guidance for information systems development efforts, contrasts the management practices of firms with successful versus unsuccessful development efforts, and suggests guidelines for improving the way in which development activities are managed.</abstract></paper>

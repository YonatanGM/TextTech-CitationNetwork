This study seeks to extend the theory of human problem solving to semantically richer domains that are characteristic of professional problem solving. We discuss the behavior of a single subject solving problems in chemical engineering thermodynamics. We use as a protocol-encoding device a computer program called SAPA which also doubles as a theory of the subjectu0027s problem-solving behavior. The subject made extensive use of means-ends analysis, similar to that observed in semantically less rich domains, supplemented by recognition mechanisms for accessing information in semantic memory.</abstract></paper>

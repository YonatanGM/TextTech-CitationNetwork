Considering its expressive power, the new formalism surpasses almost all variants of nonparallel algebraic as well as algorithmic graph grammar approaches by offering set-oriented pattern matching facilities as well as nonmonotonic reasoning capabilities for checking pre- and postconditions of rewrite rules. Furthermore, the formalism closes the gap between the operation-oriented manipulation of data structures by means of rewrite rules and the declaration-oriented description of data structures by means of logic based languages. Finally, the formalism even offers recursively defined (sub-)programs, by means of which the application of rewrite rules may be regulated. A denotational semantics definition for these (sub-)programs relies on a special variant of fixpoint theory for noncontinuous but monotonic functions.</abstract></paper>

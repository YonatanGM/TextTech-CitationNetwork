The configuration process is driven by the variabilities (i.e., the variable requirements that were implemented into the software assets in the form of variation points). During application engineering, a developer selects a consistent set of variabilities; this set is used to instantiate the family assets to the needed functionality. This paper describes the influence of this configuration step on the application-engineering process of a product family. In addition, it identifies the requirements imposed on a configuration technique by the described product family application-engineering process.</abstract></paper>

By associating both an additive and a multiplicative weight with the edges, FEVBDDs can be used to represent a wider range of functions concisely. As a result, the computational complexity for certain operations can be significantly reduced compared to EVBDDs. Additionally, the introduction of multiplicative edge weights allows us to directly represent the so-called complement edges which are used in OBDDs, thus providing a one to one mapping of all OBDDs to FEVBDDs. Applications such as integer linear programming and logic verification that have been proposed for EVBDDs also benefit from the extension. We also present a complete matrix package based on FEVBDDs and apply the package to the problem of solving the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations.</abstract></paper>

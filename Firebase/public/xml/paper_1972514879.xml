We provide a new, very direct proof of this fact using a simulation technique. Our technique is also applied to partially answer a question posed by Suciu and Paredaens regarding the complexity of evaluating powerset algebra expressions. Specifically, we show that when only unary flat relations are into play, any powerset algebra expression is either equivalent to a nested algebra expression, or its evaluation will produce intermediate results of exponential size.</abstract></paper>

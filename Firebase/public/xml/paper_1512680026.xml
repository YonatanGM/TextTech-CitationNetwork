In the hands of the Sandia National Laboratories team of James Davis and Diane Holdridge, it has held the record for the largest hard number factore since mid-1983. As of this writing, the largest number it has crackd is the 71 digit number (1071âˆ’1)/9, taking 9.5 hours on the Cray XMP computer at Los Alamos, New Mexico. In this paper I shall give some of the history of the algorithm and also describe some of the improvements that habe been suggested for it</abstract></paper>

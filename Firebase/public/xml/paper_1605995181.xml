A single group public key, instead of all public keys of individual members, is used to represent the group. A transformation is applied to convert the group public key and the message to be signed into a public parameter and thus been transmitted out. With this public parameter, a paying customer will be able to authenticate the validity of the signature with the consent of all signers. It is worth mentioning that the new group-oriented undeniable signature possesses all of the characteristics that listed in Harn and Yangu0027s. Besides, Harn and Yangu0027s scheme is generalized in this research.</abstract></paper>

For every family? whose members are unions of at mostk compact convex sets inRd in which any set ofp members of the family contains a subset of cardinalityq with a nonempty intersection there is a set of at mostc points inRd that intersects each member of?. It is also shown that for everyp?q?d+1 there is aC=C(p,q,d)u003c? such that, for every family[Figure not available: see fulltext.] of compact, convex sets inRd so that among andp of them someq have a common hyperplane transversal, there is a set of at mostC hyperplanes that together meet all the members of[Figure not available: see fulltext.].</abstract></paper>

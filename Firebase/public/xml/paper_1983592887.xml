I.e., what is the minimum possible number of edges joining equicolored vertices if we color the vertices of a given graph with n colors. In its generality the problem of finding such an optimal color assignment to the vertices (given the graph and the number of colors) is NP-complete. For each graph G, however, colors can be assigned to the vertices in such a way that the number of offending edges is less than the total number of edges divided by the number of colors. Furthermore, an @W(epn) deterministic algorithm for finding such an n-color assignment is exhibited where e is the number of edges and p is the number of vertices of the graph (eu003e=pu003e=n). A priori solutions for the minimal number of offending edges are given for complete graphs; similarly for equicolored K"m in K"p and equicolored graphs in K"p.</abstract></paper>

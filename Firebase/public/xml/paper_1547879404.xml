The author presents several hypotheses which associate computer related variables with differences in firm size. These hypotheses are tested using data collected from seventy-four Los Angeles manufacturing firms of various sizes. The results indicate that selected computer-use characteristics vary with firm size. These research findings and their implications are discussed.</abstract></paper>

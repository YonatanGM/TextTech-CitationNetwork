Although high payoffs from interactive problem-solving systems have been predicted, few such systems are in use. A key problem is the lack of understanding of the requirements of the potential users. This paper presents the results of case studies of the use of an interactive problem-solving system. Based on observations from these case studies, a list of user characteristics have been compiled relating to user behavior (e.g., data user and problem solving methods) and user requirements (e.g., the need for involvement in the solution process).</abstract></paper>

We further contend that the advent of computer supported multi-media systems does provide not just acute alternative to present information but an enrichment of our sensory and communicative possibilities that will impact society in a major way. We finally conclude that the merging of large wide-spread hypertext systems with computer supported multimedia technology into powerful hypermedia systems will indeed provide a new kind of infrastructure for working, communicating, and thinking whose influence on how mankind will live, work, teach, and learn could be quite dazzling.</abstract></paper>

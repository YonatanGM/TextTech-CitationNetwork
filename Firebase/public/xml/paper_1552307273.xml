It describes the problems associated with the current methods of communication and discusses how CBMS attempts to solve these problems. The article then presents some estimates of the costs of CBMS and potential problems that could slow down the implementation of these systems. The article concludes by outlining a methodology for developing CBMS.</abstract></paper>

However, for many tasks, one is interested in relationships among word senses, not words. This paper presents a method for automatic sense disambiguation of nouns appearing within sets of related nouns â€” the kind of data one finds in on-line thesauri, or as the output of distributional clustering algorithms. Disambiguation is performed with respect to WordNet senses, which are fairly fine-grained; however, the method also permits the assignment of higher-level WordNet categories rather than sense labels. The method is illustrated primarily by example, though results of a more rigorous evaluation are also presented.</abstract></paper>

However, despite the many lessons that can be learned from the experiences of those e-government initiatives, developing countries are still faced with various issues pertaining to their implementation of e-government services. Like many other developing countries, the e-government initiative in Qatar has faced a number of challenges since its inception in 2000. Using survey-based research, this paper examines some of these challenges from a citizensu0027 perspective. Among others, this research found that, despite a superior ICT infrastructure, issues such as lack of awareness, bureaucratic business practices and citizensu0027 satisfaction levels with the current national e-government strategy were influencing the adoption of e-government services in the State of Qatar.</abstract></paper>

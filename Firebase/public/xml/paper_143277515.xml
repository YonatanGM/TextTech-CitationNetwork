The major findings are that is objectives are associated with organizational objectives and there is a corre- spondence between each organizational objective and specific is objectives. These relationships support normative approaches to linking is objectives to those of the organization. They can be used to formulate an operationally feasible approach that can help organizations determine their is objectives according to their organizational objectives.</abstract></paper>

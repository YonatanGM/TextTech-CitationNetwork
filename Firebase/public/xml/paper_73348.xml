However, substantial numbers of people are unable or unwilling to use internet services. Usability and accessibility issues are a major deterrent to internet use and are important in usersâ€™ perceptions of websites. These are particularly important for older people, many of whom have reduced visual acuity, loss of fine motor control and other disabilities that make it more difficult to deal with poorly designed websites. We undertook two sets of experiments, the first involving an assessment of the accessibility and standards compliance of local and national e-government sites in the UK. The second focuses on sites in several other European countries. Results show significant differences between different levels of government and between standards compliance and accessibility.</abstract></paper>

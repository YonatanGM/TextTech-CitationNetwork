However, different authors use different strategies for combining multiple rules. In this paper several existing combination rules are extended in many ways and tested on sets of rules generated by different learning algorithms in several classification problems. Results indicate that the selection of the appropriate combination rule depends on the classification problem as well as on the learning algorithm. However, the naive combination of probabilities seems to be superior to other existing combination rules.</abstract></paper>

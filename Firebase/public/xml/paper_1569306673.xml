We present testing semantics for the reactive and generative models described in [vGSST90]. While there is a certain lose of the meaning of probabilities in the reactive model, testing with probabilistic tests proves to be too strong because it does not relate behavior expressions which we expect to be equivalent. This is why we introduce the limited generative model, where tests are not allowed to have explicit probabilities. We give a fully abstract characterization for the reactive model, while we give alternative characterizations (based on a set of essential tests) for the generative and limited generative models. We also present some algebraic laws for each of the models, including some laws which establish the difference between the three models.</abstract></paper>

There are a number of potential factors that could influence the usage of an IS and there are unique problems in its measurement; these make validation of the measures difficult. One area in particular has apparently been neglected: establishing the relevance of the way of measuring usage to the task or study. Data obtained from a laboratory experiment on user expectations illustrate the necessity of choosing a utilization measure that is relevant to the task involved. The data also indicate that behavioral and perceptual variables of IS evaluation ought to be considered separately when determining the level of IS success.</abstract></paper>

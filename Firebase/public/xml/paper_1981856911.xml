Visits were made to 21 user sites in the U.K. and involved structured interviews, checklists and video recordings of users at work with their GIS. Timings extracted from the videotapes were analysed alongside more subjective measures. Error messages and other feedback, and user documentation, were poorly rated by users as in the previous study. Comparison of objective and subjective measures showed a strong relationship between the amount of time wasted on errors and problems, and compatibility of the useru0027s and systemu0027s conceptual models.</abstract></paper>

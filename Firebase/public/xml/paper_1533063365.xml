When dealing with open systems in which the controlled system may execute irreversible actions, many notions of active databases must be revised and adapted to this situation. In this paper we draw the system boundaries between controlling and controlled system, present a rule system that includes events and actions both in the controlled and the controlling systems and analyze the effects of this open environment on the rule structure. We identify two new coupling modes, sequential causally dependent and exclusive causally dependent, which are necessary for handling irreversible actions in external systems and contingency plans, respectively.</abstract></paper>

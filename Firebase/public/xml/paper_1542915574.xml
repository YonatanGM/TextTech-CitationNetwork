It introduces dimensions to characterize distributed event definition, detection, production and notification. The core of our approach is a parametric event service called QUETZAL that has three interfaces, each of them implementing the given dimensions as parameters. Therefore, different event (detection) models may be defined simply by giving values to these parameters. Such an approach provides flexible definition, detection, production and notification of events according to application needs. Since our service is based on a consumer-producer principle, it can be combined with any producer and consumer, facilitating in this way communication and collaboration between distributed components such as classical applications, database transactions, primitive event detectors or event notification tools.</abstract></paper>

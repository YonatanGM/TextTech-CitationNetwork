Fig. 3). Such labelled line diagrams graphically represent the conceptual structure of triadic contexts which can be represented as three dimensional data tables. In greater detail it is elaborated how to read such diagrams and how ordinary (dyadic) conceptual structures can be determined within the triadic diagrams. For the complete order-theoretic understanding of the triadic diagrams, the necessary formal definitions are gradually introduced and illustrated in the discussion of the example about the three synoptic Gospels St. Matthew, St. Mark, and St. Luke.</abstract></paper>

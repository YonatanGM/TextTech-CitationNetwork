The major findings are that MIS structure is significantly correlated with organizational structure which, in turn, is closely associated with organizational size. Additional relationships were found between organizational size and the rank of the MIS director, between implementor/user relationships and psychological climate toward MIS, and between the last two variables and degree of MIS integration.</abstract></paper>

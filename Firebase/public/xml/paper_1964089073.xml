Its expected running time on a concurrent-read concurrent-write PRAM with O (| E | d max ) processors is O (log n ), where d max denotes the maximum degree. On an exclusive-read exclusive-write PRAM with O (| E |) processors the algorithm runs in O (log 2 n ). Previously, an O (log 4 n ) deterministic algorithm was given by Karp and Wigderson for the EREW-PRAM model. This was recently (independently of our work) improved to O (log 2 n ) by M. Luby. In both cases randomized algorithms depending on pairwise independent choices were turned into deterministic algorithms. We comment on how randomized combinatorial algorithms whose analysis only depends on d -wise rather than fully independent random choices (for some constant d ) can be converted into deterministic algorithms. We apply a technique due to A. Joffe (1974) and obtain deterministic construction in fast parallel time of various combinatorial objects whose existence follows from probabilistic arguments.</abstract></paper>

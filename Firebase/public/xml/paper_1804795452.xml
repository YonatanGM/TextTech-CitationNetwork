The security of the scheme is based on the difficulty of solving quadratic inequalities. This new system is interesting since the amount of computing needed for the proposed scheme is significantly less than that needed for an RSA encryption.This report is an investigation into the security of the proposed digital signature scheme. We demonstrate that if the system is used as it is presented, an opponent could sign messages without factoring the modulus. Further, we suggest a modification which may not have the same flaw as the proposed scheme.</abstract></paper>

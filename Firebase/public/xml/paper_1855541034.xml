Therefore they rely heavily on domain specific knowledge rather than using general problem solving techniques. Knowledge exists in two variants of considerable qualitative difference: Facts and laws of thinking. The laws of thinking are also called more formally rules of inference, since they are used to infer or to deduce new knowledge from known facts.</abstract></paper>

In particular, the time-dependencies of multimedia data require mechanisms to ensure timely and predictable delivery of data from their sources to destinations. For single medium applications which have relatively constant bandwidth utilization, connections from source to destination can be tailored to moderate ranges of data rates. On the other hand, due to the large variation in multimedia object sizes and concurrency in object presentation, multimedia applications can require a correspondingly large variation in required bandwidth over the life of a connection. Data of these types may not arrive in time to meet the intended playout schedule when the capacity of the channel is exceeded. In this paper we present an approach to remedying this situation by effectively smoothing the bandwidth requirement over time via a scheduling mechanism.</abstract></paper>

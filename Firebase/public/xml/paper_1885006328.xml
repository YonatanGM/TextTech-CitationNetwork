We describe its proxy-based approach, the port-type requirements and the set of tools implemented to facilitate configuration of experimental scenarios. Two real world devices, a wearable medical jacket and an Antarctic lake probe, deployed out in the field using this architecture are described, along with their relevance in scientific research.</abstract></paper>

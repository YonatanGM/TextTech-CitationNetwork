Reductions, in that they are relative to the property to be proved, are significantly more powerful than equivalence and minimization, and are needed to reason about complex coordinating systems. Furthermore, reduction subsumes refinement: a model M refines or “implements” a model Mu0027 provided Mu0027 reduces M relative to all assertions about M which are pullbacks of assertions in Mu0027 (so anything proved about Mu0027 remains true in the refinement M).</abstract></paper>

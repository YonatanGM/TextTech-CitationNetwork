Many of the traditional systems development life-cycle (sdlc) approaches to systems design do not provide for incorporating changes to proposed designs during development of the information system. The sequential approach taken with these traditional life-cycle methodologies can lead to the failure of the information system in a volatile situation. This paper examines past sdlc approaches, proposes an approach which incorporates flexibility into the design process and provides an example illustrating the application of the proposed methodology.</abstract></paper>

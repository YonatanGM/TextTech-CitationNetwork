The major purpose of the study was to analyze the relationship between various organizational attributes and the deployment of hardware resources. The salient finding was that the most influential variable is the distribution of decision-making processes in the organization. The more decision making is distributed, the more hardware is distributed. No significant relationships were detected between hardware distribution and any of the following variables: organizational structure, economic sectorial association, and the size of the organization.</abstract></paper>

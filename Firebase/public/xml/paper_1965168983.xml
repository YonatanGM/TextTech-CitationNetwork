The ultimate goal of these initiatives is to increase the automation of business processes. However many challenges remain to be addressed in order to reach a high-level of automation in Internet-based applications. Automatic negotiation is one of these challenges. In this paper we propose the Collaborative Agreement for Automatic Trading (CAAT), a Multi-Agent System framework that enables automatic negotiation in the context of a trading-based Web service.</abstract></paper>

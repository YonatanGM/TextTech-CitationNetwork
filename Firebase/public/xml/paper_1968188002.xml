The three key contributions of this paper are: (1) a family of location management techniques, HiPER (for Hierarchical ProfilE Replication), that efficiently provide life‐long (non‐geographic) numbering with fast location lookup; (2) Pleiades, a scalable event‐driven wireless system simulator with realistic calling and mobility patterns derived from several months of real traffic traces; and (3) multi‐day simulations comparing our proposed location management techniques with current and previously proposed techniques on a realistic geographical and network topology.</abstract></paper>

Decision support systems, which offer powerful, computer-based functions to professional nonprogrammers, place heavy demands upon training because users tend to have severe time constraints and a low tolerance for training. This paper describes the ITM and gives results of an experiment which compares the ITM to human tutors. Results show that the ITM decreases instructor time while maintaining or improving student performance. These results are quite encouraging since good human tutors are generally considered to provide the most effective individualized instruction.</abstract></paper>

For abelian varieties of dimension g in projective N space over Fq, we improve Pilau0027s result and show that the problem can be solved in O((log q)δ) time where δ is polynomial in g as well as in N. For hyperelliptic curves of genus g over Fq we show that the number of rational points on the curve and the number of rational points on its Jacobian can be computed in time \(O((\log q)^{O(g^6 )} )\)time.</abstract></paper>

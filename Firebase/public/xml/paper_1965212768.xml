A sample drawn from the 200 largest commercial banks in the United States was examined to determine the levels of programming, systems analysis, and project management effort necessary to implement interest reporting requirements of the U.S. Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) of 1982. Results of the study indicate that firms using structured systems design and programming techniques expended twice as much effort to implement the TEFRA requirements as those using non-structured approaches. It was also found that firms purchasing software expended nearly the same amount of effort as those using traditional systems analysis and programming techniques.</abstract></paper>

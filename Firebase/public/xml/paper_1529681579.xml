Nevertheless applications to problems in practice are rare. Among others one reason is that Petri nets for complex systems rapidly grow in size soon loosing their clearness and becoming unmanageable. In order to increase the abilities of Petri nets several extensions have been suggested in a more or less systematic way (e. g., inhibitor, reset arcs, transitions with special properties etc.).</abstract></paper>

Its behaviour is regulated by a biologically inspired architecture of emotion, allowing it to adapt to the useru0027s needs and feelings. In addition to giving an illusion of life, the guide emulates a real guideu0027s behaviour by presenting stories based on the useru0027s interests, its own interests, its belief and its current memory activation. A brief description of the system focusing on the core element - the guideu0027s emotional architecture - is given followed by findings from an evaluation with real users.</abstract></paper>

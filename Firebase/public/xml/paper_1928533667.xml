The semantics of traditional capabilities are modified to incorporate subject identities. This enables the monitoring, mediating, and recording of capability propagations to enforce security policies. It also supports administrative activities such as traceability. The author has developed an exception-list approach to achieve rapid revocation and the idea of capability propagation trees for complete revocation. Compared with existing capability system designs, ICAP requires much less storage and has the potential of lower cost and better real-time performance. The author proposes to expand R.Y. Kain and C.E. Landwehru0027s (1987) design taxonomy of capability-based systems to cover a wider range of designs. u003e</abstract></paper>

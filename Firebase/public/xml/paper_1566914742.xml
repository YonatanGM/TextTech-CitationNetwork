The instruction is represented as a program in a formal language that was designed for this purpose, based on the K5 microcode and the architecture of its FPU. We prove a statement of its correctness that corresponds directly with the IEEE Standard. We also derive an equivalent formulation, expressed in terms of rational arithmetic, which has been encoded as a formula in the ACL2 logic and mechanically verified with the ACL2 prover. Finally, we describe a microcode modification that was implemented as a result of this analysis in order to ensure the correctness of the instruction.</abstract></paper>

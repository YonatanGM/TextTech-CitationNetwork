The most prominent representative of this new programming paradigm is the language PROLOG, developed in the early 1970s by Colmerauer in Marseille and Kowalski in Edinburgh. Programming in PROLOG differs from conventional programming both stylistically as well as computationally, as it uses logic to represent knowledge and deduction to solve problems. Due to the success of PROLOG in the academic world, logic programming today slowly begins to find its way out of the research labs into advanced products and systems like expert system shells or knowledge-based systems.</abstract></paper>

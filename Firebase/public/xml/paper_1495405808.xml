This article reviews how marketing and sales changed in response to telecommunications and database technologies in the late 1970s; EDI, database marketing, personal computing and other technologies in the 1980s; imaging, video, CD-ROM, facsimile, and other technologies in the early 1990s; and the technologies associated with the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s. Research examining the early experiences of companies selling industrial and consumer products and services on the Web is discussed, followed by suggestions for further research.</abstract></paper>

An email gateway, for example, may be desired to test whether the email contains a keyword “urgent” so that it could route the email accordingly, without leaking any content to the gateway. This mechanism was referred as public key encryption with keyword search [4]. Similarly, a user may want to enable an email gateway to search keywords conjunctively, such as “urgent” email from “Bob” about “finance”, without leaking anything else about the email. We refer to this mechanism as public key encryption with conjunctive field keyword search. In this paper, we define the security model of this mechanism and propose two efficient schemes whose security is proved in the random oracle model.</abstract></paper>

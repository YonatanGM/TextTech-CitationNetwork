In contrast, this paper discusses the issues and challenges in the modeling of human activity in the workplace. This type of activity frequently has a large component that is unstructured, creative work. It is dynamic and difficult to capture via traditional Petri nets. Our research group at the University of Colorado has been investigating Information Control Nets (ICNs), derived from high level Petri nets, as a tool for modeling office workflow. After carefully explaining the notion of Workflow, this paper presents a formal (and also an informal) definition of ICN. We illustrate the utility of ICNs via an office analysis example.</abstract></paper>

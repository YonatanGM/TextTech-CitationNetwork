More specifically, we study their capability to capture degrees of nonsequentiality of processes. We present four full abstractness results. The operational equivalences are based on maximal action-sequences and step-sequences â€” defined for a very simple process language and its extensions with a refinement combinator (change of atomicity). The denotational models are all expressed as abstractions of a standard association of sets of labelled partial orders with processes.</abstract></paper>

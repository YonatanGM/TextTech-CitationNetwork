TeamRooms is significantly more complex than previous groupware applications, providing not only generic tools such as shared whiteboards, but also custom groupware applets running within an OpenDoc-style embedded window. As well as describing TeamRooms itself, the paper relates the use of several Tcl programming techniques -- meta-architectures, multiple interpreters, and embedded windows -- that are used to manage the resulting complexity of the system.</abstract></paper>

More precisely, it is a generalization of the algebraic approach to graph grammars which is based on gluing constructions for graphs defined as pushouts in the category of graphs. The categorical theory of high-level-replacement systems is suitable for the dynamic handling of a large variety of high-level structures in computer science including different kinds of graphs and algebraic specifications. In this paper we discuss the basic principles and techniques from category theory applied in the field of high-level-replacement systems and present some basic results together with the corresponding categorical proof techniques.</abstract></paper>

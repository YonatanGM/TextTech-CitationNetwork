After selecting a set of alternatives to achieve these objectives, you can elaborate on them during subsequent phases to make them more precise and complete. The authors argue that goal-oriented analysis complements and strengthens traditional requirements analysis techniques by offering a means for capturing and evaluating alternative ways of meeting business goals. They detail the five main steps that comprise goal-oriented analysis. These steps include goal analysis, softgoal analysis, softgoal correlation analysis, goal correlation analysis, and evaluation of alternatives. To illustrate the main elements of the proposed analysis technique, they explore a typical scenario that involves defining requirements for a meeting scheduling system.</abstract></paper>

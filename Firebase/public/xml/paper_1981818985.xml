Data gathered from 20 companies whose CBIS exert a high strategic impact on existing operating systems were studied to determine how these companies accomplished "education integration." About 80% of the companies reported training budgets between zero and two percent of the CBIS budget, with a majority of the participants reported training staffs consisting of two or less full time trainers. Of the seven educational techniques used by the companies, the Resident Expert technique rated superior in terms of quantity and quality. A description of the activities in four companies with unique approaches to the education of their user community provides additional insights into the role of organizations in promoting the integration and use of CBIS among end users.</abstract></paper>

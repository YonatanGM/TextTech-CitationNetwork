However, as :[32],"steganalysis, the estimators are subject to errors, and their magnitude seems heavily dependent on the :[47],"cover. In very recent work we have given the first derivation of estimation error, for a certain method :[67],"(the Least-Squares variant of Sample Pairs Analysis) of LSB replacement steganography in In :[80],"this paper we make use of our theoretical results to find an improved estimator and detector.

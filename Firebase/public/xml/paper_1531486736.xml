Human information processing is related to the biological specializations of the human brain. Basically, the left cerebral hemisphere performs rational, sequential, analytical functions, while the right hemisphere operates intuitively, simultaneously, and holistically. In contrast, the electronic computer performs only logical, sequential operations. The electronic computer is in this sense a model of the left brain and no the :[80],"implications emerge from this understanding. First, research using cognitive style to predict decision behavior should include intuitive styles as well as heuristic and analytical styles, even though intuition cannot be modeled in the traditional sense. Second, labor between electronic computer and human "bio-computer" for various types of organizational decision making. Third, information systems should be designed to support the type of processing required by the task, including both right and left hemisphere processes. Information systems which engage both hemispheres of the decision maker are likely to be more useful in complex tasks than those which support only the activities of the logical, left hemisphere.</abstract></paper>

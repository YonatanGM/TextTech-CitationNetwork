It is applicable as a foundation for an algebra over topological relations. The formalism is based upon the nine intersections of boundaries, interiors, and complements between two objects. Properties of topological relations are determined by analyzing the nine intersections to detect, for instance, symmetric topological relations and pairs of converse topological relations. Based upon the standard rules for the transitivity of set inclusion, the intersections of the composition of two binary topological relations are determined. These intersections are then matched with the intersections of the eight fundamental topological relations, giving an interpretation to the composition of topological relations.</abstract></paper>

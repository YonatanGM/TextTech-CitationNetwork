In particular, if the effective document length is n, then at most O(âˆšn= ln n) adversaries can defeat any watermarking :[105],"attack is, in the theoretical model, oblivious to the watermarking scheme being used; in practice, it uses very little information about the watermarking scheme. Thus, using a proprietary system seems to give only a very weak defense.</abstract></paper>

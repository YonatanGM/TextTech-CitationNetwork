Yet the commonly cited formalizations of this notion are unsatisfactory and in particular inadequate for some of the applications in which they are used. Consequently, new researchers keep getting misled by existing literature. The purpose of this paper is to indicate the source of these problems and suggest a definition which resolves them.</abstract></paper>

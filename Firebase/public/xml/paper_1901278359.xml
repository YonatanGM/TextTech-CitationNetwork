We prove that security in the single-user setting implies security in the multi-user setting as long as the former is interpreted in the strong sense of "indistinguishability," thereby pin-pointing many schemes guaranteed to be secure against Hastad-type attacks. We then highlight the importance, in practice, of considering and improving the concrete security of the general reduction, and present such improvements for two Diffie-Hellman based schemes, namely El Gamal and Cramer-Shoup.</abstract></paper>

We present a modeling formalism and a verification methodology for hybrid systems. The verification methodology is based on abstracting the continuous dynamics in the hybrid system by simpler continuous dynamics. We present two methods for doing this: in the first method, a differential inclusion is replaced with a simpler differential inclusion; in the second method, we look at the timing information that is relevant to the verification problem, and construct an abstraction of the hybrid system with a timed automaton. We illustrate our methodology by applying it to the train-gate-controller example.</abstract></paper>

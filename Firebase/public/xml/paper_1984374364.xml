Members of such a community can be eAEciently iden ti ed in a maximum ow / minim um cut framework, where the source is composed of known members, and the sink consists of well-kno wn non-members. A focused crawler that crawls to a xed depth can approximate community membership by augmenting the graph induced by the cra wl with links to a virtual sink node.The effectiveness of the approximation algorithm is demonstrated with several crawl results that iden tify hubs, authorities, w eb rings, and other link topologies that are useful but not easily categorized. Applications of our approach include focused cra wlers and search engines, automatic population of portal categories, and improved ltering.</abstract></paper>

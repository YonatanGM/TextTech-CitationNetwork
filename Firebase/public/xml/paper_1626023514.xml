They have been used extensively in areas such as computer vision, pattern recognition and computational chemistry. While computing the distance between a single pair of sets under the Hausdorff metric has been well studied, no results are known for the nearest-neighbor problem under Hausdorff metrics. Indeed, no results were known for the nearest-neighbor problem for any metric without a norm structure, of which the Hausdorff is one. We present the first nearest-neighbor algorithm for the Hausdorff metric. We achieve our result by embedding Hausdorff metrics into l/sub /spl infin// and by using known nearest-neighbor algorithms for this target metric. We give upper and lower bounds on the number of dimensions needed for such an l/sub /spl infin// embedding. Our bounds require the introduction of new techniques based on superimposed codes and non-uniform sampling.</abstract></paper>

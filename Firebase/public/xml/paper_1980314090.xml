To achieve a high-reliability design for this system, a robust hardware/software architecture has been developed with emphasis on a networking approach to functional maintenance organization. Building on this approach, a highly effective set of capabilities is provided for the detection and sectionalization of errors, and for recovery from software and hardware faults. Complete diagnostic aids are available, and flexible video display terminals provide an efficient and attractive means for telephone operating company personnel to interface to the system. Further, a wide range of automated, as well as manual, trunk and line test features are integrated into the system design; and interfaces to both local work stations and operational support systems provide a variety of options for efficient maintenance operation.</abstract></paper>

Groups of five participants performed group decision making using a general knowledge task. Group members searched for the solution by sharing information and generating alternatives. The participants were professional workers from several different organizations.The results of the study suggest that groups using the ncc system were significantly less effective than ftf groups in solving the problem. Nccs shared less information, were less comprehensive in considering all aspects of the decision-making task, and made less progress toward the perceived decision goal.</abstract></paper>

In recent years, an increasing share of systems development effort has been directed toward system to support managerial decision-making. These systems require a far greater degree of individual change than did earlier, clerical replacement systems. Successful implementation often requires changes in the usersu0027 views of their jobs. The demands that these systems place on the implementation process cause many standard development approaches to be inadequate. This article suggests some alternative approaches and points out the need for new tools.</abstract></paper>

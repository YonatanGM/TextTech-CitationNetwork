To automate the process of opinion extraction, having a collection of evaluative expressions such as “something is confortable” would be useful. However, it can be costly to manually create an exhaustive list of such expressions for many domains, because they tend to be domain-dependent. Motivated by this, we explored ways to accelerate the process of collecting evaluative expressions by applying a text mining technique. This paper proposes a semi-automatic method that uses particular cooccurrence patterns of evaluated subjects, focused attributes and value expressions.</abstract></paper>

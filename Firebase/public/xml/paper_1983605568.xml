To support adaptability and availability, a system must be able to dynamically change its behavior at runtime as user requirements, execution environments, or technologies change. Our aim is to develop a dynamic software product line in which a product line member can be dynamically modified after its deployment and thus new products can be produced during runtime without newly developing the products. To do so, we present a runtime reconfiguration framework based on reconfigurable components in supporting building dynamic product lines, particularly within the embedded software domain. Ultimately, our framework supports dynamic reconfiguration and not only reusable, but also reconfigurable components development in the context of self-managed systems.</abstract></paper>

This paper describes the Ripple Down Rules (RDR) knowledge acquisition and representation technique which does not attempt to define up front the possible context/s. Instead cases and the exception structure provide the context and rules provide the index by which to retrieve the case/s. KA is incremental. The domain expert locally patches rules as new cases are seen. Thus, RDR is a hybrid case-based and rule-based approach. The use of Formal Concept Analysis to translate the RDR performance system into a formal context and uncover an explantation system in the from of an abstraction hierarchy further strengthens our emphasis on the combined use of cases and rules to provide contextualised knowledge.</abstract></paper>

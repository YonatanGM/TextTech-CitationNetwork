The number of comparisons required is at most twice the number of votes. Furthermore, the algorithm uses storage in a way that permits an efficient use of magnetic tape. A Fortran version of the algorithm is exhibited. The Fortran code has been proved correct by a mechanical verification system for Fortran. The system and the proof are discussed.</abstract></paper>

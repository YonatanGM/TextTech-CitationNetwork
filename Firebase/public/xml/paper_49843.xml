The Yukawa equations are converted to a six-dimensional dynamical system, which is then studied for various values of the wave speed and mass parameter. The stability of the solutions is discussed, and the methods of competitive modes is used to describe parameter regimes for which chaotic behaviors may appear. Numerical solutions are employed to better demonstrate the dependence of traveling wave solutions on the physical parameters in the Yukawa model. We find a variety of interesting behaviors in the system, a few of which we demonstrate graphically, which depend upon the relative strength of the mass parameter to the wave speed as well as the initial data.</abstract></paper>

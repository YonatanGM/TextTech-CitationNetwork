Three DSS case studies are presented which illustrate that the level of user involvement can vary considerably. Based upon the existing literature, a tentative model of the dimensions affecting user involvement in the creation of a DSS is hypothesized. This model is then refined in light of the three case studies presented.</abstract></paper>

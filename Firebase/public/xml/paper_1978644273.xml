It analyses the accuracy of, and influences on, attributions of authorsu0027 identities in seven field groups with considerable work history after they used the system to enter technically anonymous comments about salient topics during a brainstorming session. GSS participants made attributions about authorsu0027 identities, but overall these attributions were about 12% accurate (ranging from 1 to 29%). The expected predictors of accuracy (an individualu0027s total communication with the group, network centrality, and length of membership in the group) were inconsistent influences across the seven groups.</abstract></paper>

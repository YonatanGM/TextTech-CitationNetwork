In this paper, we first propose a similarity measure for structured representations that is based on graph edit operations. Then we show how this similarity measure can be computed by means of state space search. Subsequently, subgraph isomorphism is considered as a special case of graph similarity and a new efficient algorithm for its detection is proposed. The new algorithm is particularly suitable if there is a large number of library cases being tested against an input graph. Finally, we present experimental results showing the computational efficiency of the proposed approach.</abstract></paper>

This work extends our previous results from Cryptou002794 [4] where an authentication scheme based on Toeplitz matrices generated by linear feedback shift registers was :[45],"new results have as special case the LFSR-based construction but extend to a much wider and general family of sequences, including several simple and efficient constructions with close to optimal security. Examples of the :[45],"new constructions include Toeplitz matrices generated by the Legendre symbols of consecutive integers modulo a prime (of size significantly shorter than required by public-key modular arithmetic) as well as other algebraic constructions. The interest of these schemes extends beyond the proposed cryptographic applications to other uses of universal hashing (including other cryptographic applications).</abstract></paper>

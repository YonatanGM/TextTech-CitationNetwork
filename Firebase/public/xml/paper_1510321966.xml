Requirements are viewed as knowledge bases and the knowledge representation formalism for the prototype, also the language for implementing IRIS, is Telos which provides facilities for describing entities and relationships and for representing and reasoning with temporal knowledge. The generation of a design is achieved with a mapping process from requirements which is: (i) Locally guided by dependency types determining allowable mappings of an element of a requirements model, (ii) globally guided by non-functional requirements, such as accuracy and security requirements on the intended system, represented as goals describing desirable properties of the intended system and used to guide local decisions.</abstract></paper>

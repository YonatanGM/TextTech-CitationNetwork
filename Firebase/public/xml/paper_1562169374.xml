In this paper, we describe our analysis technique which accepts a behavioral specification of the timing of a digital system and generates the set of all possible behaviors for the system. The ability to represent and reason about time ranges for events is a distinguishing characteristic of our technique and gives our analysis method both its power and complexity.</abstract></paper>

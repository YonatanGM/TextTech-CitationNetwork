Both the system and its processes are described in terms of Petri nets. We prove a theorem which gives a correspondence between a property of the processes called D-continuity and a set of properties of the system. D-continuity has first been introduced as a generalisation of the Dedekind completeness properties of the real numbers. Our main result shows that a system has only D-continuous processes iff it is safe (in the sense that its capacities are finite), behaviourally connected (in the sense that its infinite processes use all parts of the system) and satisfies another (minor) property.</abstract></paper>

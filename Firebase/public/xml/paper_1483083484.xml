Schnorru0027s original scheme had its security based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in a subgroup of GF(p) given some side information. We prove that our modification will be witness hiding, which is a more rigid security condition than Schnorr proved for his scheme, if factoring a large integer with some side information is computationally infeasible. In addition, even if the large integer can be factored, then our scheme is still as secure as Schnorru0027s scheme. For this enhanced security we require only slightly more communication and about a factor of a 3.6 increase in computational power, but the requirements remain quite modest, so that the scheme is well suited for use in smart cards.</abstract></paper>

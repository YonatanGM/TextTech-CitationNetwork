However, process modelling techniques are not without their criticisms. This paper proposes and uses the Bunge-Wand-Weber (BWW) representation model to analyse the four views - process, data, function, and organisation - provided in the Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) popularised by Scheer [39, 40, 41]. The BWW representation model attempts to provide a theoretical base on which to evaluate and thus contribute to the improvement of information systems modelling techniques. The analysis conducted in this paper prompts some propositions. Among others, it confirms that the process view alone is not sufficient to model all the real-world constructs required. However, even when considering all four views in combination, problems may arise in representing all potentially required business rules, and specifying the scope and boundaries of the system under consideration, and employing a "top-down" approach to analysis and design.</abstract></paper>

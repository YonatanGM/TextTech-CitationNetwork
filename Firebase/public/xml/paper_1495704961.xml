In particular, finite algebras have recently gained considerable attention. Unification in the sense of Plotkin is based upon the notion of a set of most general unifiers, which however might either not exist or — at the other extreme — be too large. As a remedy to these conceptual drawbacks we suggest a redefinition of unification, such that with respect to this view unification in finite algebras becomes unitary. Previous work on unification in Postalgebras provides a universal unification algorithm. We will add a more application oriented approach. Applications of our methods to the switch level design of digital circuits are indicated.</abstract></paper>

Their relevance and application to machine learning is given, and their relative performance empirically evaluated. A method of accounting for noisy data is given and also applied. The reliability of estimates is measured by a significance measure, which is also empirically tested. We briefly discuss the use of likelihood ratio as a significance measure.</abstract></paper>

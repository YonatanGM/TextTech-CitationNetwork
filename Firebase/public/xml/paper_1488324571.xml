The described workflow concept can provide interoperability among different types of legacy applications on heterogeneous computational platforms, such as Condor or Globus based grids. The major design and implementation issues concerning the integration of Condor tools, Mercury grid monitoring infrastructure, PROVE performance visualisation tool, and the new workflow layer of P-GRADE are discussed in two scenarios. The integrated version of P-GRADE represents the thick client concept, while the portal version needs only a thin client and can be accessed by a standard web browser. To illustrate the application of our approach in the grid, an ultra-short range weather prediction system is presented that can be executed in a grid testbed and visualised not only at workflow level but at the level of individual parallel jobs, too.</abstract></paper>

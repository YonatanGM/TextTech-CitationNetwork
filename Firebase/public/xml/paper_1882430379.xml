After their (mainly theoretical) introduction by S. Goldwasser, S. Micali and C. Rackoff (1985), A. Fiat and A. Shamir (1986) proposed a first practical solution: the scheme of Fiat-Shamir is a trade-off between the number of authentication numbers stored in each security microprocessor and the number of witness numbers to be checked at each verification.This paper proposes a new scheme which requires the storage of only one authentication number in each security microprocessor and the check of only one witness number. The needed computations are only 2 or 3 more than for the scheme of Fiat-Shamir.</abstract></paper>

However, it is not generally complete for real geometry and is unable to handle inequality problems. Collinsu0027 method is complete for real geometry and is able to handle inequality problems, but is not, at the moment, able to prove some of the more challenging theorems in a practical amount of time and space. This paper presents a combination that is capable of proving theorems beyond the theoretical reach of Wuu0027s method and the (current) practical reach of Collinsu0027 method. A proof of Pompeiuu0027s theorem using this combination is given, as well as a list of several other challenging theorems proved using this combination.</abstract></paper>

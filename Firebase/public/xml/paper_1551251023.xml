As the demand for time management in workflow applications increases, temporal coordination can no longer be limited to being a result of value dependencies between activities. It must be conceptualized, modeled and supported as a part of the WFMS. In this work, we propose a temporal process specification model and develop formalism to determine the consistency of the specification. In the execution level, we show that finer control on activities execution can be achieved by exploiting their temporal constraints. Furthermore, we discuss different scheduling policies to illustrate the trade-off between temporal-constraint violation and missed deadline.</abstract></paper>

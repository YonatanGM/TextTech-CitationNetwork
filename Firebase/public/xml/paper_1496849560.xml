In this paper we present an anti-stack-smashing defense technique for Microsoft Windows systems. Our approach works at install-time, and does not rely on having access to the source-code: The user decides when and which executables to vaccinate. Our technique consists of instrumenting a given executable with a mechanism to detect stack smashing attacks. We developed a prototype implementing our technique and verified that it successfully defends against actual exploit code. We then extended our prototype to vaccinate DLLs, multithreaded applications, and DLLs used by multi-threaded applications, which present significant additional complications. We present promising performance results measured on SPEC2000 benchmarks: Vaccinated executables were no more than 8% slower than their un-vaccinated originals.</abstract></paper>

Besides having a rich set of pre-defined composite event expressions and a well-defined execution model, ADOME-11 supports an extensible approach to reactive processing so as to be able to gracefully accommodate dynamic applicationsu0027 requirements. In this approach, production rules combined with methods are used as a unifying mechanism to process rules, to enable incremental detection of composite events, and to allow new composite event expressions to be introduced into the system declaratively. Methods of supporting new composite event expressions are described, and comparisons with other relevant approaches are also conducted. A prototype of ADOME-II has been constructed, which has as its implementation base an ordinary (passive) OODBMS and a production rule base system.</abstract></paper>

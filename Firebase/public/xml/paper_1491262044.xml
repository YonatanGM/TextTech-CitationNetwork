The discrete logarithm problem can therefore be solved using index calculus algorithms as long as k is the :[50],"elliptic curve case it was shown by Menezes, Okamoto and Vanstone that for supersingular curves one has k â‰¤ 6. In this paper curves of higher genus are studied. Bounds on the possible values for k in the case of supersingular curves are given which imply that supersingular curves are weaker than the general case for cryptography. Ways to ensure that a curve is not supersingular are also :[120],"constructive application of supersingular curves to cryptography is given, by generalising an identity-based cryptosystem due to Boneh and Franklin. The generalised scheme provides a significant reduction in bandwidth compared with the original scheme.</abstract></paper>

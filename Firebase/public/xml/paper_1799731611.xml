It allows citizens, businesses and other authorities to have 24 hours access to public services from their home, their offices or even on the move using different access media and devices. The concept requires that all public authorities are interconnected and that the citizen is able to access public services by a single point even if these services are actually provided by different departments or authorities. One-stop government requires the reengineering of the public sector’s processes towards online public services. It calls for a holistic framework that supports integrated modelling of electronic public services and synchronisation with the technical developments.</abstract></paper>

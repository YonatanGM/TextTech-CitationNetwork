Our technique, based on an extended safe pointer representation, has a number of novel aspects. Foremost, it is the first technique that detects all spatial and temporal access errors. Its use is not limited by the expressiveness of the language; that is, it can be applied successfully to compiled or interpreted languages with subscripted and mutable pointers, local references, and explicit and typeless dynamic storage management, e.g., C. Because it is a source level transformation, it is amenable to both compile- and run-time optimization. Finally, its performance, even without compile-time optimization, is quite good. We implemented a prototype translator for the C language and analyzed the checking overheads of six non-trivial, pointer intensive programs. Execution overheads range from 130% to 540%; with text and data size overheads typically below 100%.</abstract></paper>

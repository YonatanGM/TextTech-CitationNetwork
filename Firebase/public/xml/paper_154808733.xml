Our recent work in eliciting and managing requirements from a process-perspective allows deriving a logical architecture but fails to provide a business and strategic view of the system. Adaptation of standard techniques to infer goals and requirements from scenarios and process-like diagrams, mapping backwardly the traditional business to process workflow, could help in building a business model and defining a strategy for the information system. We extend our V-Model approach with a Business Motivation Model representation, guided by a RUP-based backward transformation from process to business, so allowing for better and continuous alignment between Business and IS/IT, with improved traceability.</abstract></paper>

We compare the graphs of congruential systems with a well known family of infinite graphs: the regular graphs of finite degree considered by Muller and Shupp, and by Courcelle. We first consider congruential systems as word rewriting systems to extract some subfamilies of congruential systems, the q-p-congruential systems, representing the regular graphs of finite degree. We then prove the non-regularity of the Collatzu0027s graph.</abstract></paper>

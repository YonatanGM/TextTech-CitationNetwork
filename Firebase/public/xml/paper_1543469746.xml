This methodology is based on a hierarchical model of interpreters. This model allows us to define formal specifications at each level of abstraction and successively prove the correctness between the neighbouring abstraction levels, so that the overall specification is correct with respect to its hardware implementation. The correctness proofs have been split into two steps so that the parallelism in the execution due to the pipelining of instructions, is accounted for. The first step shows that the instructions are correctly processed by the pipeline and the second step shows that the semantic of each instruction is correct. We have implemented the specification of the entire model and performed parts of the proofs in HOL.</abstract></paper>

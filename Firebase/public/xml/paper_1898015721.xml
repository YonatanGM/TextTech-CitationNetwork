Although the quality of an IS is determined largely by the development process, relatively little attention has been paid to the methodology for achieving high quality. A recent proposal [32] takes a process-oriented approach to representing non-functional, or quality, requirements (NFRs) as potentially conflicting or harmonious goals and using them during the development of software systems. By treating security requirements as a class of NFRs, this paper applies this process-oriented approach to designing secure ISs. This involves identification and representation of various types of security requirements (as goals), generic design knowledge and goal interactions. This treatment allows reusing generic design knowledge, detecting goal interactions, capturing and reasoning about design rationale, and assessing the degree of goal achievement. Security requirements serve as a class of criteria for selecting among design decisions, and justify the overall design. This paper also describes a prototype design tool, and illustrates it using a credit card system example.</abstract></paper>

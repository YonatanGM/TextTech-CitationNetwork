In previous work we have presented a formal framework for reasoning with goal models, in a qualitative or quantitative way, and we have introduced an algorithm for forward propagating values through goal models. In this paper we focus on the qualitative framework and we propose a technique and an implemented tool for addressing two much more challenging problems: (1) find an initial assignment of labels to leaf goals which satisfies a desired final status of root goals by upward value propagation, while respecting some given constraints; and (2) find an minimum cost assignment of labels to leaf goals which satisfies root goals. The paper also presents preliminary experimental results on the performance of the tool using the goal graph generated by a case study involving the Public Transportation Service of Trentino (Italy).</abstract></paper>

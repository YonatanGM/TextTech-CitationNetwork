There seems, however, to be no way to build such a system that is both secure and has a public key of practical size when the devices used to limit the number of coefficeints are nilpotence and J-rings. We have only shown, however, that it is impossible to produce such a system if the total degree of the encryption polynomial determines the size of the public key. Perhaps, by properly choosing p 0 and p 1, we can employ the fundamental scheme to produce sparse encrypting polynomials. Then the public key could be kept small while the encrypting polynomial bas large total degree and is difficult to invert.</abstract></paper>

While agreeing with the need for a sharper focus for IS research, this paper suggests that past problems with relevance can be avoided by engaging the academic and practitioner communities in setting a research agenda using an “open source” approach. Such an approach would assure that academic researchers remain focused on relevant issues in a fast-moving field, and offers an opportunity to draw the academic and practitioner communities closer together for their mutual benefit.</abstract></paper>

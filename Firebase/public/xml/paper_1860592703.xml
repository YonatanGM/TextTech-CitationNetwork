While the basic ideas of frame systems are straightforward, complications arise in their design and use. The authors have developed a design strategy for avoiding these types of problems and have implemented a representation system based on it. The system, called Krypton, clearly distinguishes between definitional and factual information. In particular, Krypton has two representation languages, one for forming descriptive terms and one for making statements about the world using these terms. Further, Krypton provides a functional view of a knowledge base, characterized in terms of what it can be asked or told, rather than in terms of the particular structures it uses to represent knowledge. 11 references.</abstract></paper>

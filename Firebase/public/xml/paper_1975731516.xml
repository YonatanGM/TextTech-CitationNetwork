This is especially true in databases used for complex decision support queries and/or object-relational databases. In this paper, we describe an algorithm that detects sub-optimality of a query execution plan during query execution and attempts to correct the problem. The basic idea is to collect statistics at key points during the execution of a complex query. These statistics are then used to optimize the execution of the query, either by improving the resource allocation for that query, or by changing the execution plan for the remainder of the query. To ensure that this does not significantly slow down the normal execution of a query, the Query Optimizer carefully chooses what statistics to collect, when to collect them, and the circumstances under which to re-optimize the query. We describe an implementation of this algorithm in the Paradise Database System, and we report on performance studies, which indicate that this can result in significant improvements in the performance of complex queries.</abstract></paper>

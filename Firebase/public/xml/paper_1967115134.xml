The approach leads to an analysis of defeasible inheritance which is both well-defined and intuitively attractive: it yields unambiguous results applied to any acyclic semantic network, and the results conform to our intuitions in those cases in which the intuitions themselves are firm and unambiguous. Since the definition provided here is based on an alternative, skeptical view of inheritance reasoning, however, it does not always agree with previous definitions when it is applied to nets about which our intuitions are unsettled, or in which different reasoning strategies could naturally be expected to yield distinct results. After exploring certain features of the definition presented here, we describe also a hybrid (parallel-serial) algorithm that implements the definition in a parallel marker-passing architecture.</abstract></paper>

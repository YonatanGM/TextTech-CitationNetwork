In this paper we further clarify how bisimulation arises in this probabilistic setting: the transitions of two labelled transition systems can be assigned weights so that the trees are indistinguishable by a very general kind of probabilistic experiment iff the trees are bisimilar. However, we exhibit a pair of computable, bisimilar systems which are experimentally distinguishable for any computable weighting of their transitions.</abstract></paper>

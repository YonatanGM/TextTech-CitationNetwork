In the architecture Jini provides the infrastructure for resource lookup, while Condor manages the job execution on the individual clusters. Semi on-line application monitoring is also available in this structure, moreover it works even through firewalls. Beside Condor the presented Jini based Grid can support other local jobmanager implementations, thus various types of sequential or parallel jobs could be executed with the same framework.</abstract></paper>

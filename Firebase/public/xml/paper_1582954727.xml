To benefit from all of them, it should be possible to link together modules written in different parallel languages in a single application. Since the paradigms sometimes differ in fundamental ways, this is difficult to accomplish. This paper describes a framework, Converse, that supports such multi-lingual interoperability. The framework is meant to be inclusive, and has been verified to support the SPMD programming style, message-driven programming, parallel object-oriented programming, and thread-based paradigms. The framework aims at extracting the essential aspects of the runtime support into a set of core components, so that language-specific code does not have to pay overhead for features that it does not need.</abstract></paper>

The approach proposed by S/MIME is to concatenate all ciphertexts. However, it suffers from poor scalability due to its linear computation and communication cost. In this paper, we propose a new practical and secure scheme, called multiplex encryption. By combining the ideas of identity-based mediated RSA and re-encryption mix network, our framework only requires constant computation and communication cost to encrypt a multi-recipient email.</abstract></paper>

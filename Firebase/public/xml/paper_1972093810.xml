Thus, automated recognition of abstract concepts may greatly assist the human understanding process. This paper describes an approach to automated concept recognition and its implementation. In the approach, we use a concept model and a library of concept recognition rules to describe what the concepts are and how to recognize them from lower-level concepts. Programming language knowledge as well as domain knowledge are used to aid the recognition of abstract concepts.</abstract></paper>

Such a model of computation is, clearly, turing powerful. This model has been used as the backbone of ISO protocol specification languages Estelle and SDL, as it allows one to abstract away from the details, such as errors in communication, that occur at lower levels of the protocol stack. It has recently been shown (in the literature) that realistic models which implicitly model errors in the communication buffers are more tractable than models which assume perfect communication. In this paper, we propose to make the model more realistic by modeling the probability of loss in the buffers. Given specifications in such a model we provide algorithms for the probabilistic reachability problem and the probabilistic model-checking (in linear-time PTL) problem.</abstract></paper>

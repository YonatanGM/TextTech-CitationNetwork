A careful closure procedure is introduced which, when applied to a database DB , produces a new database DB∗ , that is used to answer queries about predicates from DB . It is shown that DB∗ is consistent iff DB is consistent. If P is the set of all predicates from DB and DB does not contain functional symbols, then DB∗ coincides with Minkeru0027s GCWA. The soundness and completeness of the careful closure procedure with respect to a minimal model style semantic is shown. As an inference engine associated with DB∗ we propose a query evaluation procedure QEP∗ which is a combination of a method of splitting an indefinite database DB into a disjunction of Horn databases and Clarku0027s query evaluation procedure QEP . Soundness of QEP∗ with respect to DB∗ is shown for a broad class of databases.</abstract></paper>

In order to get a global picture of the behavior of a customer, his single transactions have to be composed together. In On-Line Analytical Processing, this operation is known as reverse pivoting. With the ongoing data analysis process, reverse pivoting has to be repeated several times, usually requiring an implementation in SQL. In this paper, we present a construction for conceptual scales for reverse pivoting in Conceptual Information Systems, which directly interacts with the visualization. The construction allows the reuse of previously created queries without reprogramming and offers a visualization of the results by line diagrams.</abstract></paper>

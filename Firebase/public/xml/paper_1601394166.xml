It was shown that ITL provides a way to view programming constructs for assignment, repetition and parallelism as logical operators. This paper demonstrates the applicability of ITL to some problems given in the STL concurrency workshop. These include a bidirectional channel, a railway and a message-routing network.</abstract></paper>

Many techniques for the first problem (a) have been developed. The second problem (b) seems to be much harder: It is the general belief that computation privacy for mobile code cannot be provided without tamper resistant hardware. Furthermore it is doubted that an agent can keep a secret (e.g., a secret key to generate digital signatures). There is an error in reasoning in the arguments supporting these beliefs which we are going to point :[116],"this paper we describe software-only approaches for providing computation privacy for mobile code in the important case that the mobile code fragment computes an algebraic circuit (a polynomial). We further describe an approach how a mobile agent can digitally sign his output securely.</abstract></paper>

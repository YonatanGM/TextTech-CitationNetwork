This paper first stresses the need to define new process models to underlie better the specifications development process. Second, it provides an overview of the solution proposed in the esprit project NATURE project, in the context of the Requirements Engineering phase. Then, the emphasis is put on the need to precisely model the IS development product in order to support process modeling. A product model is thus detailed, argued and illustrated on examples.</abstract></paper>

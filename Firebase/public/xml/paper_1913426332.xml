This model is based on a notion of intelligent agents, called messengers, that visit u0027regimesu0027-formalized electronic front offices-of these agencies, and assemble the various requirements into a customized procedure for the client. On the clientu0027s approval, the procedure may then be executed by the messenger, delivering and collecting the appropriate electronic documents and payments. The scheme relies on a common representation for regimes. One such representation, called Candid is presented. Various implementation aspects are also discussed.</abstract></paper>

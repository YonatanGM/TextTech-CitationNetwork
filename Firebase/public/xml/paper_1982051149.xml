We show that approximating the length of a shortest set of linearly independent vectors (shortest basis) within any constant factor is NP-hard. Under the assumption that problems in NP cannot be solved in DTIME(n p”‘y’og(n)) we show that no polynomial time algorithm can approximate the length of a shortest set of linearly independent vectors (shortest basis) within a factor of 2’“g’-‘(“), E u003e 0 arbitrary, but fixed. Finally, we obtain results on the limits of non-approximability for computing short linearly independent vectors (short basis). Our strongest result in this direction states that under reasonable complexity-theoretic assumptions, approximating the length of a shortest set of linearly independent vectors (shortest basis) within a factor of n/a is not NP-hard.</abstract></paper>

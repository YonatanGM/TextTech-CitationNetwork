Thus, first we review how the various kinds of consistency problems were formulated in that setting. Then, and this is the first contribution of our note, we try to reduce, as much as possible, the UML problems to that frame. That analysis, we believe, is rather clarifying in itself and allows us to better understand what is new and what instead could be treated in terms of that machinery. We conclude with some directions for handling those problems, basically with constrained modelling methods that reduce and help precisely individuate the sources of possible inconsistencies.</abstract></paper>

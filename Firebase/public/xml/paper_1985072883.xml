We extend to this logic, and to the logic containing the more powerful iterative-fixed-point operator, the zero-one law proved for first-order logic in ( Glebskii, Kogan, Liogonki, and Talanov (1969) , Kibernetika 2 , 31–42; Fagin (1976) , J. Symbolic Logic 41 , 50–58). For any sentence φ of the extend logic, the proportion of models of φ among all structures with universe {1,2,…, n } approaches 0 or 1 as n tends to infinity. We also show that the problem of deciding, for any φ , whether this proportion approaches 1 is complete for exponential time, if we consider only φ u0027s with a fixed finite vocabulary (or vocabularies of bounded arity) and complete for double-exponential time if φ is unrestricted. In addition, we establish some related results.</abstract></paper>

The schemes are provably secure against any known or chosen message attack if factoring is difficult, and typical implementations require only 1% to 4% of the number of modular multiplications required by the RSA scheme. Due to their simplicity, security and speed, these schemes are ideally suited for microprocessor-based devices such as smart cards, personal computers, and remote control systems.</abstract></paper>

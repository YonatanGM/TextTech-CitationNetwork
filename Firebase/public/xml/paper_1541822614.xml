Considering its expressive power, the new formalism is intended to contain almost all forms of nonparallel algebraic as well as algorithmic graph grammar approaches as special cases. Furthermore, our formalism tries to close the gap between the operation oriented manipulation of data structures by means of graph rewrite rules and the declaration oriented description of data structures by means of logic based languages.</abstract></paper>

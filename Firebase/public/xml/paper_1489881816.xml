This paper presents some new results on unconditionally secure multi-receiver authentication codes. First we generalize a polynomial construction due to Desmedt, Frankel and Yung, to allow multiple messages be authenticated with each key. Second, we propose a new flexible construction for multi-receiver A-code by combining an A-code and an (n, m, k)-cover-free family. Finally, we introduce the model of multi-receiver A-code with dynamic sender and present an efficient construction for that.</abstract></paper>

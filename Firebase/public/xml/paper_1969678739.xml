Advances have occured so rapidly that often the results has been “islands” of automation and information subsystems, such as CAD/CAM, robotics, group technology, and office automation. Some recent developments, however, provide capabilities for integrating these “islands” into systems which both improve manufacturing productivity and produce more meaningful management information. Integrated systems seem imminent. Suggestions that could help ensure a smooth evolution toward these systems are made and some conclusions are drawn.</abstract></paper>

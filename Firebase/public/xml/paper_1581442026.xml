A cover for L from U is a set C⊂U with L a subset of the convex hull of C. Suppose c is the size of a smallest such cover, if it exists. The randomized algorithm given here finds a cover of size no more than c(5dln c), for c large enough. The algorithm requires O(c2n1+δ) expected time. More exactly, the time bound is :[86],"+ \delta } :[86],"+ c(nc)^{1/(1 :[86],"+ \gamma /(1 :[86],"+ \delta ))} :[98],"where γγ1/[d/2]. The previous best bounds were cO(log n) cover size in O(nd) time.[MS92b] A variant algorithm is applied to the problem of approximating the boundary of a polytope with the boundary of a simpler polytope. For an appropriate measure, an approximation with error e requires c=O(d/e)d−1 vertices, and the algorithm gives an approximation with c(5d3 ln(1/e)) vertices. The algorithms apply ideas previously used for small-dimensional linear programming.</abstract></paper>

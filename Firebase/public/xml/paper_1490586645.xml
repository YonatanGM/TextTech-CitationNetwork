They both have large block sizes, and are based on the Luby-Rackoff construction. Their underlying components are a hash function and a stream cipher, and they are provably secure in the sense that attacks which find their keys would yield attacks on one or both of the underlying components. They also have the potential to be much faster than existing block ciphers in many applications.</abstract></paper>

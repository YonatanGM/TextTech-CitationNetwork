A consequence of this is that analyses of professional languages may be applied advantageously in connection with system development. This paper builds its arguments around a single example: The change in the professional language of nurses in connection with the use of computers in a hospital ward. In the first part of the paper we give a description of the situation before and after the system concerned was introduced. Furthermore we present some basic concepts of semiotics. The second part of the paper contains a semiotic analysis of the situation within the hospital ward under examination. And finally, the last part of the paper draws some general conclusions from the analysis.</abstract></paper>

We will refer to these as the OSS schemes. The security of the schemes rest in part on the difficulty of finding solutions to :[42],"X^2 - KY^2 \equiv M(mod{\mathbf{ }}n), :[49],"n is the product of two large rational primes. In the original OSS scheme [OSS1], K, M, X, and Y were to be rational integers. However, when this version succumbed to an attack by Pollard [PS,S1], a new version was introduced [OSS2], where M, X, and Y were to be quadratic integers, i. e. elements of the ring \( Z[\sqrt d ] \). In this paper we will show that the OSS system in \( Z[\sqrt d ] \) is also breakable The method by which we do this is to reduce the problem of solving the congruence over the ring \( Z[\sqrt d ] \) to the problem of solving the congruence over the integers, for which we can use Pollardâ€™s algorithm.</abstract></paper>

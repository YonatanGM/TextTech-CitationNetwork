Investigations have concerned the concept of a translating computer interface as a means to simplify access to, and operation of, heterogeneous bibliographic retrieval systems and databases. The interface allows users to make requests in a common language. These requests are translated by the interface into the appropriate commands for whatever system is being interrogated. System responses may also be transformed by the interface into a common form before being given to the users. Thus, the network of different systems is made to look like a single “virtual” system to the user. The interface also provides instruction and other search aids for the user. The philosophy, design, and implementation of an experimental interface named CONIT are described.</abstract></paper>

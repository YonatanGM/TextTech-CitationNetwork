In this paper we extend this problem to one where there is more than one secret that participants can reconstruct using the information that they hold. In particular we consider the situation where there is a secret sK associated with each k-subset K of participants and sK can be reconstructed by any group of t participants in K (t ? k). We establish bounds on the minimum amount of information that participants must hold in order to ensure that up to w participants (0 ? w ? n - k + t - 1) cannot obtain any information about a secret with which they are not associated. We also discuss examples of systems that satisfy this bound.</abstract></paper>

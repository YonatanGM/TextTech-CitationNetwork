Encryption/decryption in a single key cryptoalgorithm is a paradigm of such an operation, with the key being the private (secret) piece of information. Although it is implicit, it is almost never stated explicitly that in a single-key cryptographic communications link, the transmitter and the receiver must unconditionally trust each other since either can do anything that the other can.</abstract></paper>

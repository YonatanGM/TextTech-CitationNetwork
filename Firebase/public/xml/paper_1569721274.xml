For appropriate choices of [d,k] these sequences possess large periods, balanced k-distributions, large linear complexities, and moderate out-of-phase autocorrelation magnitudes. Furthermore, they are easy to generate. These properties suggest that [d,k] self-decimated sequences may have some applications in cryptography and spread spectrum communication.</abstract></paper>

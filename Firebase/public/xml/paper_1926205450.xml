Current practice in Requirement Engineering relies on process-oriented methodologies, which lack of product features. The resulting scenario then is a collection of general methodologies, which do not take into account product features that may enhance our ability in monitoring and controlling Requirements Evolution. This paper shows empirical investigations of two industrial case studies. The results point out evolutionary product features and identify an Empirical Framework to analysing Requirements Evolution. This work represents a shift from process to product-oriented management of Requirements Evolution.</abstract></paper>

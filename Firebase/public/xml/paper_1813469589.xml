The relatively slow speed of secondary storage devices holding the data is one of the main limitations of database design. Hence, the internal organization of databases has been the primary focus of research in the past. Another major influence on database research was the need to share information among a variety of users. In such an environment, strict rules governing the manipulation of data had to be imposed to preserve the integrity of the database and to guarantee privacy for each user. These needs led to the development of several basic data models. With the steadily increasing demand for user-oriented systems, however, new trends in database technology have evolved outside of the scope of the traditional data models. In this article the authors are concerned with two closely related efforts: (1) The incorporation of more semantic modeling capabilities into database models. (2) The development of better user environments, which include user-friendly interfaces and support different user views of the content and organization of the data.</abstract></paper>

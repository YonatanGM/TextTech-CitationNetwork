By using image processing and pattern recognition manipulation functions, structure information and features of images are extracted and ntegrated into relational databases. A relational query language, Query by Pictorial Example (QPE) is introduced for manipulating queries regarding spatial relations as well as conventional queries. In addition to the manipulating capabilities of the usual query languages, queries can also be expressed in terms of pictorial examples through a display terminal. An experimental system for LANDSAT images is implemented as an illustrative example.</abstract></paper>

However, architectural information does not exist directly in the artifacts that we can extract. The architecture exists in abstractions; compositions of extracted information. Thus, extracted artifacts must be able to be flexibly aggregated and combined. We call this process "view refinement and fusion". This paper presents a workbench for architectural extraction called Dali, and shows how Dali supports flexible extraction and fusion of architectural information. Its use is described through two extended examples of architectural reconstruction.</abstract></paper>

Harness is an experimental metacomputing system based upon the principle of dynamic reconfigurability not only in terms of the computers and networks that comprise the virtual machine, but also in the capabilities of the VM itself. These characteristics may be modified under user control via a "plug-in" mechanism that is the central feature of the system. In this paper we describe our preliminary experience in the design of PVM emulation by means of a set of plug-in.</abstract></paper>

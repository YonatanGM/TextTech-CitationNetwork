This single-pushout construction is shown to coincide with the well-known double-pushout description of graph rewriting whenever the latter is defined. In general, the conditions for the single pushout to exist are weaker than those required for the double pushout. In some categories of graphs, no conditions at all are necessary.</abstract></paper>

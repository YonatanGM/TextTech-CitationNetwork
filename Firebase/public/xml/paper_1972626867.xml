Todayu0027s research tries to move software development to a new quality of industrial production. Several solutions concerning different phases of the software development process have been proposed in order to cope with different problems of program family development. A major problem of program family engineering is still the missing tool support. The vision is an IDE that brings all phases of the development process together consistently and in a user-friendly manner. This paper focuses on AHEAD, a prominent design methodology and architectural model for feature-based program families. We present our first results on developing an Eclipse-based IDE that supports building program families following the AHEAD architecture model. Starting from current weaknesses and pitfalls in implementing program families we outline several challenges of the feature-based development process. Thereupon, we present our ideas to face these challenges and a resulting integrated tool chain based on Eclipse.</abstract></paper>

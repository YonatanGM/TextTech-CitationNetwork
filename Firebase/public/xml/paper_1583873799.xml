Our study, based on data from 104 end users in six large companies, examines the individual, organizational, and system factors affecting the success of EUC, as reflected in end user satisfaction. A key result is that the leadership style of information system managers is positively and significantly related to user satisfaction. Other findings of the study indicate that significant positive relationship exist between user satisfaction and hardware/software accessibility and availability, computer background of users, user attitudes toward end user computing, and system utilization. The results also demonstrate that computer anxiety and user age are negatively related with end user satisfaction. No significant relationships were found between user satisfaction and gender, education, and organizational level. Implications of the findings for practicing information systems managers are discussed.</abstract></paper>

The basic definitions, issues, and examples of various setup attacks (called Kleptographic attacks) have also been presented. The goal of this work is to describe a methodological way of attacking cryptosystems which exploits certain relations between cryptosystem instances which exist within cryptosystems. We call such relations “kleptograms”. The identified kleptogram is used as the base for searching for a setup.</abstract></paper>

These problems include determining the degree of the least common multiple of a set of such polynomials, and related problems. The proofs make use of a homomorphism from Boolean expressions over the predicate symbols { P 1 ,…, P n } onto divisors of the polynomial x N −1, where N is the product of the first n primes. Various combinatorial and number theoretic applications are also presented.</abstract></paper>

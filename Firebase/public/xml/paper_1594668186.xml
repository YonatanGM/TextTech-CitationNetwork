In this paper we introduce basic definitions of security for homomorphic signature systems, motivate the inquiry with example applications, and describe several schemes that are homomorphic with respect to useful binary operations. In particular, we describe a scheme that allows a signature holder to construct the signature on an arbitrarily redacted submessage of the originally signed message. We present another scheme for signing sets that is homomorphic with respect to both union and taking subsets. Finally, we show that any signature scheme that is homomorphic with respect to integer addition must be insecure.</abstract></paper>

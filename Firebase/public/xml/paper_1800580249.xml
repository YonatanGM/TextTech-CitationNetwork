The behaviour of parallel programs formed by simple networks of such processes can sometimes be described by binary relations, that are computed from the processes. Those relations yield rules that show how to find a non-deterministic sequential program "equivalent" to the original parallel program. Two examples illustrate the results presented.</abstract></paper>

To find out, simply perform the operator α on D 0 (by applying αu0027s elementary add and delete revision operators to D 0 ). We describe this process as progressing the database D 0 in response to the action α. In this paper, we consider the general problem of progressing an initial database in response to a given sequence of actions. We appeal to the situation calculus and an axiomatization of actions which addresses the frame problem (Reiter [14], Lin and Reiter [7]). This setting is considerably more general than STRIPS. Our results concerning progression are mixed. The (surprising) bad news is that, in general, to characterize a progressed database we must appeal to second order logic. The good news is that there are many useful special cases for which we can compute the progressed database in first order logic; not only that, we can do so efficiently.</abstract></paper>

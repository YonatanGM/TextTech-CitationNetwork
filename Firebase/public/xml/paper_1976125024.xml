Specifically, for any two points a and b of S there is a path along edges of the triangulation with length less than √10 times |ab|, where |ab| is the straight-line Euclidean distance between a and b. Thus, a shortest path in this planar graph is less than about 3 times longer than the corresponding straight-line distance. The triangulation that has this property is the L 1 metric Delaunay triangulation for the set 5. This result can be applied to motion planning in the plane. Given a source, a destination, and a set of polygonal obstacles of size n, an O(n) size data structure can be used to find a reasonable approximation to the shortest path between the source and the destination in O(n log n) time.</abstract></paper>

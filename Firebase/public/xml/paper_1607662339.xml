Three dimensional graphics and a tabular mode of presentation were used to convey information to two experimental groups of subjects. The graphics were produced by using perspective projections. The outcome was that the three dimensional graphics did not result in greater recall of information than did a tabular representation for the task that was assigned.</abstract></paper>

Redefined models become the blueprints for improved business activities. The cost to produce models of the organization is high and model accuracy is important. How do models help support understanding of business processes? Should functional business personnel or systems analysts create business models for the organization? How are models validated? From their experience with applying EMS technology and re-engineering techniques with actual organizations, the authors discuss benefits of broad involvement during modeling and improvement idea generation. They discuss their experiences using group technology to support groups during the modeling of business activities using the IDEF modeling method, and discuss aspects of broad involvement that influence the quality of the resulting models. u003e</abstract></paper>

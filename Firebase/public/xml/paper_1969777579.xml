The uniform word problem, the finiteness problem, the triviality problem (whether A is the one element algebra), and the subalgebra membership problem (whether a given element of A is contained in a finitely generated subalgebra of A ) for finitely presented algebras are shown to be ≤ m log -complete for P. The schema satisfiability problem and schema validity problem are shown to be ≤ m log -complete for NP and co-NP, respectively. Finally, the problem of isomorphism of finitely presented algebras is shown to be polynomial time many-one equivalent to the problem of graph isomorphism.</abstract></paper>

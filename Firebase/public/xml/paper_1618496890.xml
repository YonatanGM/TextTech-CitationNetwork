One of the few remaining variants is Patarinu0027s”Oil u0026 Vinegar” scheme, which is based on a system of n quadratic forms in 2n variables of two flavors (n ”oil” variables and n ”vinegar” variables). The security of the scheme depends on the difficulty of distinguishing between the two types, and does not seem to be susceptible to known low rank attacks. In this paper we describe two novel algebraic attacks which can efficiently separate the oil and vinegar variables, and thus forge arbitrary signatures.</abstract></paper>

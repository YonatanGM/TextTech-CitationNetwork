This paper describes a hybrid analytical/empirical method for feature generation for inductive concept learning. The goal of this method is to be able to generate useful features to improve problem solving performance in intractable domains, given only a theory of the domain and the ability to perform in the domain. An implementation of this method is able to generate useful features for the OTHELLO board game, given just a domain theory and the ability to interact with an opponent.</abstract></paper>

Frameworks for addressing both issues are presented. is strategic postures vary along several dimensions, including the level and scope of the system view as well as the degree of participation of the is function in overall organizational planning. Current is planning methodologies differ in: components of the organization used as planning pivots, assumptions indicating perceived stability of components, and is objectives reflected in the methodology. Those assumptions and objectives implicit in a methodology dictate their suitability for given strategic postures. A contingency framework is used in examining selected is planning and development methodologies.</abstract></paper>

In order to interpret and apply rules containing such terms, appeal must be made to their previous constructions, as in the interpretation of legal statutes through relevant legal cases. We describe a system CABARET (CAse-BAsed REasoning Tool) that provides a domain-independent shell that integrates reasoning with rules and reasoning with previous cases in order to apply rules containing ill-defined terms. The integration of these two reasoning paradigms is performed via a collection of control heuristics, which suggest how to interleave case-based methods and rule-based methods to construct an argument to support a particular interpretation. CABARET is currently instantiated with cases and rules from an area of income tax law, the so-called “home office deduction”. An example of CABARETu0027s processing of an actual tax case is provided in some detail. The advantages of CABARETu0027s hybrid approach to interpretation stem from the synergy derived from interleaving case-based and rule-based tasks.</abstract></paper>

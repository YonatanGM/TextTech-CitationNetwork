We present several such dual ciphers of Rijndael, such as the square of Rijndael, and dual ciphers with the irreducible polynomial replaced by primitive polynomials. We also describe another family of dual ciphers consisting of the logarithms of Rijndael.We then discuss self-dual ciphers, and extend our results to other ciphers.</abstract></paper>

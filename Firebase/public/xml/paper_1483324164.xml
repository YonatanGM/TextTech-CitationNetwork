The equations assume an infinitely large population and require the enumeration of all points in the search space. When implemented as a computer program, the equations can be used to study problems of up to approximately 15 bits. These equations represent an extension of earlier work by Bridges and Goldberg. At the same time these equations are a special case of a model introduced by Vose and Liepins. The various models are reviewed and the predictive behavior of the executable equations is examined. Then the executable equations are extended by quantifying the behavior of a reduced surrogate operator and a uniform crossover operator. In addition, these equations are used to study the computational behavior of a parallel island model implementation of the simple genetic algorithm.</abstract></paper>

The main idea is to allow probability guards of value 0 to be associated with alternatives of a probabilistic summation expression. Such alternatives can be chosen only if the non-zero alternatives are precluded by contextual constraints. We refer to this model as one of “extremal probability” and to its signature asPCCSζ. We providePCCSζ with a structural operational semantics and a notionof probabilistic bisimulation, which is shown to be a congruence. Of particular interest is the abstractionPCCSπ ofPCCSζ in which all non-zero probability guards are identified.PCCSπ represents a customized framework for reasoning about priority, and covers all features of process algebras proposed for reasoning about priority that we know of.</abstract></paper>

Learners are given a set of design criteria and a library of components which they use to design artifacts that will satisfy the specified criteria. Despite their appeal, design-centered learning environments are plagued with complexities that can overwhelm learners. To address this problem, we have developed a proactive problem-solving focus mechanism that helps learners cope with the complexities inherent in design-centered learning. By exploiting a rich model of the design context, the focus mechanism selects design problems and intervenes with multimedia advice. The mechanism has been implemented in Design-A-Plant, a design-centered learning environment for botanical anatomy and physiology. Formative evaluations with middle school students are encouraging.</abstract></paper>

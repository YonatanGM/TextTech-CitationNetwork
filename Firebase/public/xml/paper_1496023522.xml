The experiment involved examining whether different ways of reporting a specific standard cost accounting situation resulted in differences in managersu0027 evaluations. When actual costs differed significantly from standard, it was found that the form of the accounting report did have an impact on evaluations. The presentation and the frequency of the report were found to be important variables in MIS design which affected managersu0027 evaluations.</abstract></paper>

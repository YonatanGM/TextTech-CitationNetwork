Protocols that tolerate not only site failures, but also network partitions were studied. Only pessimistic protocols that maintain availability without sacrificing one-copy serializability have been considered. Pessimistic schemes can be classified as being static or dynamic. Newly developed static and dynamic schemes are described. Plans for further investigations are outlined. u003e</abstract></paper>

A consideration which discourages the use of an arbitrary elliptic curve is that one needs Schoof’s algorithm [16] to count the order of the corresponding group, and this algorithm, in addition to being rather complicated, has running time O(log9 q) for an elliptic curve defined over Fq. Thus, in applications of elliptic curves where one needs extremely large q — for example, the original version of the elliptic curve primality test ([4], [11]) — this algorithm is too time-consuming.</abstract></paper>

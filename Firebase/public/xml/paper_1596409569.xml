Suchelements usually appear in graphic models as splits and joins of activitysequences. Workflow patterns reflect possible executions of differentconfigurations of splits and joins. However, despite the importance of processflow control and workflow patterns, no way exists yet to assure that a particularset of patterns is complete and non-redundant. We use an ontologically-based model of business processes to analyze the control configurations that can existin a process model. A process is modeled in terms of state changes of thedomain in which the process occurs. The state changes are controlled by lawswhich model the actions allowed in the domain. This model is notationindependentand enables incorporating goals into process analysis. We use themodel to suggest classification of control configurations and identifyconfigurations that assure the enacted process can always reach its goal.</abstract></paper>

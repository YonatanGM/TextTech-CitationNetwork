After reviewing the traditional technique based on a single search tree, we demonstrate how an approach based on multiple levels of search trees offers advantages in both memory and execution complexity. Further execution time improvements are obtained by exploiting the concept of “event locality”. We apply our technique to three large parametric models, and give detailed experimental results.</abstract></paper>

K data hits are to be encoded into N u003e K bits and transmitted over a noiseless channel. An intruder can observe a subset of his choice of size µ u003c N. The encoder is to be designed to maximize the intruderu0027s uncertainty about the data given his N intercepted channel bits, subject to the condition that the intended receiver can recover the K data bits perfectly from the N channel bits. The optimal tradoffs between the parameters K, N, µ. and the intruderu0027s uncertainty H (H is the "conditional entropy" of the data given the µ. intercepted channel bits) were found. In particular, it was shown that for µ = N - K, a system exists with H ? K - 1. Thus, for example, when N = 2K and µ = K, it is possible to encode the K data bits into 2K channel bits, so that by looking at any K channel bits, the intruder obtains essentially no information about the data.</abstract></paper>

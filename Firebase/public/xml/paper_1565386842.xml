M. Fischer pointed out that Rabinu0027s original implementation of the Oblivious Transfer was not shown to be secure. Since then it has been an open problem to find a provably secure implementation. We present an implementation which we believe will simplify the development of secure cryptographic protocols. Our protocol is provably secure under the assumptions that factoring is hard and that the message is chosen at random from a large message space.</abstract></paper>

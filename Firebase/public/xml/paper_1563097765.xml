It focuses on applications growth, and uses the experiences of six small manufacturing firms to identify motivators and inhibitors of growth. Many factors were identified. Motivators of growth included improved enthusiasm for the technology. Inadequate resources and limited education about information systems were among the factors that inhibited application growth.</abstract></paper>

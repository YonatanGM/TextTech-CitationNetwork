By now, it is one of the best understood and developed branches of the theory of graph grammars providing mainly a graph-grammatical counterpart to context-free Chomsky grammars. But there is more to it than just context-freeness. Hyperedge replacement has got some other facets to overcome — at least to a certain degree — the restricted generative power and :[84],"hyperedge replacement with a mode of rewriting like OL- and replacement with replacement with :[98],"required or forbidden replacement with :[104],"rule-selection specifications like path :[84],"hyperedge replacement :[111],"generating potentially infinite graphs.</abstract></paper>

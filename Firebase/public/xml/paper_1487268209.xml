The designs are implemented on the Virtex-E FPGA family of devices. FPGAs have proven to be very effective in implementing encryption algorithms. They provide more flexibility than ASIC implementations and produce higher data-rates than equivalent software implementations. A novel, generic, parameterisable Rijndael encryptor core capable of supporting varying key sizes is presented. The 192-bit key and 256-bit key designs run at data rates of 5.8 Gbits/sec and 5.1 Gbits/sec respectively. The 128-bit key encryptor core has a throughput of 7 Gbits/sec which is 3.5 times faster than similar existing hardware designs and 21 times faster than known software implementations, making it the fastest single-chip FPGA Rijndael encryptor core reported to date. A fully pipelined single-chip 128-bit key Rijndael encryptor/decryptor core is also presented. This design runs at a data rate of 3.2 Gbits/sec on a Xilinx Virtex-E XCV3200E-8-CG1156 FPGA device. There are no known single-chip FPGA implementations of an encryptor/decryptor Rijndael design.</abstract></paper>

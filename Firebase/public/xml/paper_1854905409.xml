The prototyping process is examined from three behavioral perspectives: cognitive, social, and organizational. Support technology is then characterized along the functional dimensions of production, coordination, and organizational technology, and performance measurement framework is developed using the dimensions of process/product and levels of analysis (task, social, and strategic). It is proposed that the primary determinant of performance impact is the fit between the prototyping processes and the support technology used. By combining a functional model of support technology with behavioral perspectives of the prototyping process, a better understanding of the impacts of technology on prototyping effectiveness is obtained. u003e</abstract></paper>

Some theorists have adopted an “operational” approach, focusing on the manifest effects of suggesting metaphoric comparisons to learners. Some have resolved the question formally into a “structural” definition of metaphor. However, structural and operation approaches typically ignore the goal-directed learner-initiated learning process through which metaphors become relevant and effective in learning. Taking this process seriously affords an analysis of metaphor that explains why metaphors are intrinsically open-ended and how their open-endedness stimulates the construction of mental models.</abstract></paper>

The SCUA was implemented using the MICE multimedia conferencing applications with built-in encryption and the security infrastructure developed in the Password Project. Both MICE and PASSWORD were projects of the European Union. The paper describes the first prototype of the SCUA which was developed by GMD in the MICE project and the planned enhancements of it.</abstract></paper>

It is a combined approach using a new powerful data model for the description of storage structures and a set-oriented user interface with an Object Buffer and extensibility to achieve a closer connection to the application programs. First evaluations that have been made will be presented here. They resulted in a deeper knowledge of the real requirements of geoscientific applications. A partial redesign of the DASDBS GEO-Kernel resulting from this experiences will be presented here too. It enhances the capabilities of the application oriented Object Buffer and the external type interfaces for very large data items.</abstract></paper>

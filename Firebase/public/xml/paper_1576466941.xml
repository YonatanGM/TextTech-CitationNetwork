We propose two ways to improve model tracing tutors and in particular the Andes physics tutor. First, tutors should fade their scaffolding. Although most model tracing tutors have scaffolding that needs to be gradually removed (faded), Andesu0027 scaffolding is already "faded," and that causes student modeling difficulties that adversely impact its tutoring. A proposed solution to this problem is presented. Second, tutors should integrate the knowledge they currently teach with other important knowledge in the task domain in order to promote deeper learning. Several types of deep learning are discussed, and it is argued that natural language processing is necessary for encouraging such learning. A new project, Atlas, is developing natural language based enhancements to model tracing tutors that are intended to encourage deeper learning.</abstract></paper>

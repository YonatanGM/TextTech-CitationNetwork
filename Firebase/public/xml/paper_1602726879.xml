To this end, the behavior of the models is defined by partially ordered causal runs, represented by process nets. We discuss how these runs are constructed and visualized for validation purposes, and how they are analyzed. Moreover, we demonstrate how different dynamic properties can be formulated and checked by searching respective patterns in process nets.</abstract></paper>

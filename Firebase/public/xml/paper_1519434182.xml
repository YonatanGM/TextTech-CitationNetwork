ITP is an interactive system providing convenient access to and control of the many inference mechanisms of Logic Machine Architecture (LMA), described elsewhere, LMA itself has been substantially enhanced since the last report on its status, and we describe here some of the enhancements, particularly the addition of a tightly-coupled logic programming component, which provides an integration of the theorem-proving and logic programming approaches to problems represented in the predicate calculus.</abstract></paper>

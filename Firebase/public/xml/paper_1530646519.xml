In this paper, we present an analytical calculation of the success probability of these attacks. Besides providing a sound formulation of the success probabilities, the analysis reveals some previously unnoticed factors affecting the success of an attack, such as the attacked key length in differential cryptanalysis. The results apply to an extended sense of the term "success" where the correct key is found not necessarily as the highest-ranking candidate but within a set of highest-ranking candidates.</abstract></paper>

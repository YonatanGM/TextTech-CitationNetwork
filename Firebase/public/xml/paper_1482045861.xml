However, in order to enable large-scale PVM applications to effectively manage the enormous volumes of data they usually generate, ePVM needs a parallel file system. This paper presents ePIOUS, the optimized porting of the PIOUS parallel file system under ePVM. ePIOUS has been designed so as to take into account the two-levels physical network topology characterizing the “cluster grids” normally built by ePVM. To this end, ePIOUS exploits the ePVM architecture to implement a file caching service that is able to speed up file accesses across clusters.</abstract></paper>

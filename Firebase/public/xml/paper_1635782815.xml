In order to develop highly reusable core assets, PLSE must have the ability to exploit commonality and manage variability among products from a domain perspective. Feature modeling is one of the most popular domain analysis techniques, which analyzes commonality and variability in a domain to develop highly reusable core assets for a product line. Various attempts have been made to extend and apply it to the development of software product lines. However, feature modeling can be difficult and time-consuming without a precise understanding of the goals of feature modeling and the aid of practical guidelines. In this paper, we clarify the concept of features and the goals of feature modeling, and provide practical guidelines for successful product line software engineering. The authors have extensively used feature modeling in several industrial product line projects and the guidelines described in this paper are based on these experiences.</abstract></paper>

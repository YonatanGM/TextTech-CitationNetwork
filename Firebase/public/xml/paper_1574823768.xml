The standard recurrence relation for binary and nonbinary genetic algorithms is solved using an inductive proof and a proof using linear finite difference equations. This result is used to estimate the average and worst case time complexity for genetic algorithms. The resulting equations define the relationship between estimated run time, problem size, fitness ratio and the complexity of the domain specific evaluation function for domains with constant fitness ratio for binary and nonbinary GAs. The fitness ratio is a characteristic of the problem domain reflecting the relative merit of some candidate solutions over others.</abstract></paper>

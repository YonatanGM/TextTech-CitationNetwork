Branching bisimulation is obviously decidable for finite state processes. A proof that it is also decidable for reduced and proper context-free processes has been given by Huttel. Going further along these lines, we prove that the class of reduced and proper context-free processes is closed under quotient by their greatest branching bisimulation.</abstract></paper>

We found the S-Boxes consume much of the total AES circuit power and the power for an S-Box is mostly determined by the number of dynamic hazards. In this paper, we propose a low-power S-Box circuit architecture: a multi-stage PPRM architecture over composite fields. In this S-Box, (i) the signal arrival times of gates are as close as possible if the depths of the gates from the primary inputs are the same, and (ii) the hazard-transparent XOR gates are located after the other gates that may block the hazards. A low power consumption of 29 µW at 10 MHz using 0.13 µm 1.5V CMOS technology was achieved, while the consumptions of the BDD, SOP, and composite field S-Boxes are 275, 95, and 136 µW, respectively.</abstract></paper>

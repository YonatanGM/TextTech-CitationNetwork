The model M is given as a parallel composition of ?-automata Pi, where each automaton Pi is constrained by bounds on delays. The property T is given as an ?-automaton as well, and the verification problem is posed as a language inclusion question L(M) ? L(T). In constructing the composition M of the constrained automata Pi, one needs to rule out the behaviors that are inconsistent with the delay bounds, and this step is (provably) computationally expensive. We propose an iterative solution which involves generating successive approximations Mj to M, with containment L(M) ? L(Mj) and monotone convergence L(Mj) ? L(M) within a bounded number of steps. As the succession progresses, the approximations Mj become more complex. At any step of the iteration one may get a proof or a counter-example to the original language inclusion question. The described algorithm is implemented into the verifier Cospan. We illustrate the benefits of our strategy through some examples.</abstract></paper>

The complexity of a development endeavour leading to migration of a legacy system stresses the need for a systematic supporting approach. We argue in this paper that such an approach should facilitate (a) documentation of dependencies between business processes and supporting IS in a way that changes in the business level are reflected on system specifications and (b) quantification of effects of business changes on the associated migration from legacy systems so that alternative solutions can be systematically evaluated and the optimal solution can be chosen. In this paper we put forward an approach to meeting these two objectives based on the confluence of two technologies: Enterprise Knowledge Modelling and Knowledge Discovery in Data. The approach is demonstrated using examples from a project involving a banking application.</abstract></paper>

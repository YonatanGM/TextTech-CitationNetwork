Fair public-key cryptosystems guarantee that: (1) the system cannot be misused by criminal organizations and (2) the Citizens mantarn exactly the same rights to privacy they currently have under the law.We actually show how to transform any public-key cryptosystem into a fair one. The transformed systems preserve the security and efficiency of the original ones. Thus one can still use whatever system he believes to be more secure, and enjoy the additional properties of fairness. Moreover, for todayu0027s best known cryptosystems, we show that the transformation to fair ones is particularly efficient and convenient.As we shall explain, our solution compares favorably with the Clipper Chip, the encryption proposal more recently put forward by the Clinton Administration for solving similar problems.</abstract></paper>

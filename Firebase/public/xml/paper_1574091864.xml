They have to be flexible and responsive to stimuli which cause them to change. Process technology must relect these characteristics if it is to find realistic application. This paper illustrates how the evolutionary nature of processes may be supported in a particular process technology, that originally developed in the IPSE 2.5 project.</abstract></paper>

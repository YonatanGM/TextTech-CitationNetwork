Two techniques for theorem proving that utilize term rewriting are presented. The first technique simulates the replacement of predicates by their definitions in a Skolemtzed setting. The second technique permits tautologies to be recognized quickly. We demonstrate their effectiveness by exhibiting the results of our experiments in proving some theorems of von Neumann-Bernays-Godel set theory. We also show how the first technique can be used in any clausal theorem prover. Some outstanding problems associated with term rewriting are also addressed.</abstract></paper>

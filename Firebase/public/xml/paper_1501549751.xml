Many of its characteristics (block size, application domain, performance and implementation structure) are similar to those of the U.S. Data Encryption Standard (DES). It is based on a Feistel network, in which the cleartext is split into two sides with one side repeatedly modified according to a keyed function of the other. Previous block ciphers of this design, such as DES, operate on equal length sides. MacGuffin is unusual in that it is based on a generalized unbalanced Feistel network (GUFN) in which each round of the cipher modifies only 16 bits according to a function of the other 48. We describe the general characteristics of MacGuffin architecture and implementation and give a complete specification for the 32-round, 128-bit key version of the cipher.</abstract></paper>

On the one hand, business models need to be intuitive and easy to understand. On the other hand, ambiguities may lead to different interpretations and false consensus. Moreover, to configure process-aware information systems (e.g., a workflow system), the business model needs to be transformed into an executable model. Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs), but also other informal languages, are intended as a language to support the transition from a business model to an executable model. Many researchers have assigned formal semantics to EPCs and are using these semantics for execution and verification. In this paper, we use a different tactic. We propose a two-step approach where first the informal model is reduced and then verified in an interactive manner. This approach acknowledges that some constructs are correct or incorrect no matter what interpretation is used and that the remaining constructs require human judgment to assess correctness. This paper presents a software tool that supports this two-step approach and thus allows for the verification of real-life EPCs as illustrated by two case studies.</abstract></paper>

Some ideas are presented for clarifying the nature of cognitive styles, and a number of cognitive style models are discussed which are applicable to information system design and research. Suggestions are presented for assisting information system analysts in incorporating the usersu0027 cognitive styles differences into information systems design and some problems are indicated which could arise during implementation. Finally, experimental design factors are outlined for improving research into the cognitive styles area.</abstract></paper>

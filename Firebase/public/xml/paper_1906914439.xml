Although major fault detection problems have been known to be in general NP-complete, they were proven for rather complex circuits. In this correspondence we show that these are still NP-complete even for monotone circuits, and thus for unate circuits. We show that for k-level (k â‰¥ 3) monotone/unate circuits these problems are still NP-complete, but that these are solvable in polynomial time for 2-level monotone/unate circuits. A class of circuits for which these fault detection problems are solvable in polynomial time is presented. Ripple-carry adders, decoder circuits, linear circuits, etc., belong to this class. A design approach is also presented in which an arbitrary given circuit is changed to such an easily testable circuit by inserting a few additional test-points.</abstract></paper>

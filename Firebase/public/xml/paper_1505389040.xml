Collaborative healthcare workflows (CHWF) are inherently complex, involving interactions among human actors, and (legacy) digital and physical systems. They are mission safety critical, privacy sensitive, and open to changes of requirements and environments. The complexity makes the definition, understanding, analysis, management, and monitoring of CHWF a software engineering challenge. We propose an approach to formal modeling and analysis of CHWF. The main problems that the approach addresses are abstraction and separation of concerns through algebraic manipulation. We use the CSP process algebra for modeling and verifying the dynamic interaction behavior of processes, and discuss the relation between the dynamic model and the static model of healthcare cases and resources. We use UML models to visualize the systemu0027s behavior and structure, but definitions of the syntax and semantics of these graphical models and their relation to the CSP models are left for future work.</abstract></paper>

The RSEXEC creates an environment which facilitates the sharing of resources among Hosts on the ARPANET. The large Hosts, by making a small amount of their resources available to small Hosts, can help the smaller Hosts provide services which would otherwise exceed their limited capacity. By sharing resources among themselves the large Hosts can provide a level of service better than any one of them could provide individually. Within the environment provided by the RSEXEC a user need not concern himself directly with network details such as communication protocols nor even be aware that he is dealing with a network.</abstract></paper>

Our contribution to this problem is the definition of a systematic way by which fragments of process models can be generated by reusing method knowledge acquired in previous projects. We propose a method for generating methods i.e. a meta method. The meta method uses method construction patterns that are named method chunks. The paper presents the meta method, illustrates its use for the construction of requirements engineering centred methods and gives details of some method chunks necessary to support this construction.</abstract></paper>

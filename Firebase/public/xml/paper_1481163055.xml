The authors argue that DSS language evaluation and selection should be a multi-step process involving most, if not all of the :[43],"End User Needs Assessment and Problem :[50],"Critical Success Factor :[54],"Feature Analysis and Capability :[59],"Demonstration Prototype :[62],"External User :[65],"Benchmark and Simulation :[69],"Programmer Productivity and :[43],"End User Orientation :[76],"objectives of each of these activities are described, as well as specific procedures for accomplishing them. In addition, the authors discuss the usefulness of a multi-disciplinary task force to accomplish the DSS language evaluation and selection process.</abstract></paper>

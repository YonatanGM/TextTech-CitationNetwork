Buffered delta networks have queues of packets between the stages of the network. This paper presents analytic and simulation results for the performance of delta networks in a packet communication environment. The performance of buffered delta networks is compared with unbuffered delta networks and crossbar switches. It is demonstrated that buffering produces considerable improvement in the performance of these networks, making their performance comparable to that of crossbar switches.</abstract></paper>

The method shows the inadequacy of the Bell and LaPadula model, in particular, and the impossibility of any adequate definition of a secure system based solely on the notion of a secure state. The implications for the fruitfulness of seeking a global definition of a secure system and for the state of foundational research in computer security, in general, is discussed.</abstract></paper>

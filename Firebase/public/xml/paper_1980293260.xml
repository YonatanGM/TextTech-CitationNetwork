While QUILT contains many features typically available in a GIS, its primary purpose is to serve as a testbed for the design and testing of new data structures and algorithms for use in computer cartography. Quadtree variants for region, point and line data are implemented using the linear quadtree, organized on disk by a B-tree. QUILT provides a simple attribute attachment system which associates non-spatial data with geographic objects. The user views QUILT as an augmented LISP environment. QUILTu0027s geographic functions include conversion of rasters to and from quadtrees; subset operations to select specified geographic objects; map editing, display, windowing, intersection and union operations; polygon expansion; and computation of geographic object properties such as the centroid, area, perimeter and bounding rectangle for sets of geog...</abstract></paper>

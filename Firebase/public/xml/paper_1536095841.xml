Three selected rules expressing the local character of transitionu0027s activity are admitted as axioms for interpretation. The nets are "structured" because they can be built up of simpler nets by a concurrency constructor (11) with handshaking. From axioms we infer a necessary and sufficient condition for a net to be decomposable with respect to a given partition of places. In particular, we examine decomposition into atomic, not further decomposable nets. A number of examples illustrate the considerations.</abstract></paper>

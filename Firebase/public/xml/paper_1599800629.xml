The work presented concerns the design and development of a user interface component, which employs adaptability and adaptivity techniques to tailor itself to the abilities, skills, requirements and preferences of individual users, the different contexts of use, and the changing characteristics of run-time interaction between the user and the system.</abstract></paper>

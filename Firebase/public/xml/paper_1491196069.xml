In particular, we will develop an expansion theorem for real time concurrency, which is an extension of the expansion theorem of CCS. The essential step made in this work is that a more general form of action prefix, μ@t.P is introduced, where t is a time variable. Intuitively, μ@t.P is an agent which may perform μ and become P[d/t] in doing so, where t is replaced by d, the time delay before μ is actually performed. The original form μ.P of action prefix of CCS is just a simple case of μ@t.P when t does not occur free in P — P does not depend on the time at which μ is performed.</abstract></paper>

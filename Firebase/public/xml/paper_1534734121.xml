The authors argue that effective management of DSS development :[29],"An explicit plan for the full development life :[38],"Careful assignment of responsibility for DSS :[45],"Appropriate user involvement and direction; :[51],"On-going user needs assessment and problem :[58],"13-stage tactical plan for DSS development, called the DSS development life cycle, is described. Results are presented from an in-depth survey of users of 34 different DSS to show that the tasks performed most ineffectively in DSS development are planning, assessment of user needs, and system evaluation. Results from the survey are also presented that show the factors responsible for DSS project approval, and the factors responsible for DSS success.</abstract></paper>

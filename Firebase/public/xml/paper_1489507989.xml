Teaching and research support these organization needs. The field may be defined in terms of observed information systems in organizations and also in terms of the function or field of activity for system planning, development, management, and evaluation. Since the systems deal with capture, repositories, processing, and communication of data, information, and knowledge, these are also defined.</abstract></paper>

The density of A is defined as \(\rho(A)=\sum^n_{i=1} (1/a_i)\) . In this paper we limit ourselves to instances composed of three distinct integers. The best scheduler [5] published previously can schedule all instances with a density of less than 0.77. A new and fast scheduling scheme based on spectrum partitioning is presented in this paper which improves the 0.77 result to a new \(\frac{5}{6}\approx 0.83\) density threshold. This scheduler has achieved the tight schedulability bound of this problem.</abstract></paper>

With this shift in emphasis, concerns have been raised about information security. Examples of abuse of the Internet abound and unfortunately ATM networks are subject to many of these same abuses. This is of subtanstial concern when thinking about extending the reach of public data networking to broad segments of society.</abstract></paper>

In this paper, we propose such a new candidate problem. namely the problem of predicting a sequence of consecutive Legendre (Jacobi) symbols modulo a prime (composite), when the starting point and possibly also the prime is unknown. Clearly, if this problem turns out to be hard, it can be used directly to construct a cryptographically strong pseudorandom bitgenerator. Its complexity seems to be unrelated to any of the well known number theoretical problems, whence it may be able to survive the discovery of fast factoring or discrete log algorithms. Although the randomness of Legendre sequences has part of the folklore in number theory at least since the thirties, they have apparently not been considered for use in cryptography before.</abstract></paper>

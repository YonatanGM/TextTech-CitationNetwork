Our goal is to provide a suite of realistic applications that will serve as a well-documented and consistent basis for evaluation studies. We describe the applications currently in the suite in detail, discuss some of their important characteristics, and explore their behavior by running them on a real multiprocessor as well as on a simulator of an idealized parallel architecture. We expect the current set of applications to act as a nucleus for a suite that will grow with time.</abstract></paper>

Our study, involving several hundred I/S graduates over a four-year period, measures the importance of “above-average salaries” to these graduates as they progress through the early months of their I/S careers. Initially, salary is ranked highly; but as time passes, other factors tend to crowd out salary in importance. It loses its role as a motivator; and, as Herzberg suggests, becomes a hygiene factor.</abstract></paper>

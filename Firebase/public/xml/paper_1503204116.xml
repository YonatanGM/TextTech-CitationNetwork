Variables range over sets of terms described by systems of set constraints that can express limited inter-variable dependencies. These sets of terms are more general than regular tree languages, but are still closed under intersection. The new unification algorithm shows sorted unification to be decidable for a broad class of sorted signatures, which we call semilinear, and, more generally, for sort theories with a least Herbrand model that can be represented using the new constraints. A finite representation of a complete set of wellsorted unifiers can always be found, even in those cases where this set is infinite.</abstract></paper>

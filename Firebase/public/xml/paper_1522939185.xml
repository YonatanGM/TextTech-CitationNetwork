In this chapter we introduce a Petri net based approach to support such activities. Business processes are modeled using standard place/transition nets enhanced with some notions needed to integrate all aspects of business processes that are relevant with respect to analysis purposes, e.g., the notion of time and costs. The Petri net models of business processes are simulated by generating partially ordered runs. We will show how these runs can then be used for performance analysis of important key indicators such as throughput :[112],"introduced concepts are summarized in a 3-step approach that supports users to base their decision between possible alternatives for the design of a business process on facts.</abstract></paper>

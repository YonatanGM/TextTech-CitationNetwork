The resulting computational procedures have improved properties (avoidance of numerical problems and, in some cases, fewer operations) compared to previous algorithms. Furthermore, the new algorithms have a physically meaningful interpretation which provides the basis for heuristic extensions that allow the approximate solution of networks with a very large number of closed chains, and which is shown to be asymptotically valid for large chain populations.</abstract></paper>

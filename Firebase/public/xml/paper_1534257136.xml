This paper introduces a complementary process based approach that is founded on measuring business process quality attributes. These quality attributes are defined on the basis of ISO/IEC 9126 Software Product Quality Model. The new process quality attributes are applied in an experiment and results are discussed in the paper.</abstract></paper>

The examples demonstrate that so-called ‘relational models’ in common DBMS may in some cases even be to rich. Thus it is not sufficient, to extend a DBMS for commercial applications by statistical operators. In some cases, it may even be necessary to restrict the set of operators. In order to check semantically integrity constraints, a DBMS for statistical applications needs knowledge on the lattice structure of observational units (design knowledge) and on the concepts underlying the observational units and attributes (model knowledge). This type of knowledge has so far been not considered, because it is of little importance for commercial applications. For statistical applications, however, it is necessary to avoid semantically meaningless analyses and to assist the user in performing analyses.</abstract></paper>

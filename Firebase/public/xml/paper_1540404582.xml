In the pioneering article of Chari, Rao and Rohatgi, the general idea behind template attacks was introduced. Template attacks apply advanced statistical methods and can break implementations secure against other forms of side-channel :[44],"in our research it turned out that several details, which are essential to practical implementations of template attacks, still need to be answered. In this article we provide answers to open issues, such as how to select points of interest :[44],"in an efficient way, or how to preprocess noisy data. In addition, we show the benefits of trial classifications and we point out that :[44],"in practice so-called amplified template attacks have to be considered as a potential threat.</abstract></paper>

Most present systems place the burden of combination on the user, e.g. the user specifies 50% texture features, 20% color features, etc. This is a problem since most users do not know how to best pick the settings for the given data and search problem. The paper addresses this problem, describing research in progress for a system that: (1) automatically infers which combination of models best represents the data of interest to the user; and (2) learns continuously during interaction with each user. In particular, these two components-inference and learning-provide a solution that adapts to the subjective and hard to predict behaviors frequently seen when people query or browse image libraries.</abstract></paper>

The design of WIBOs is based on principles of intelligence, autonomy, collaboration and co-operation. Using WIBOs that carry out tasks on usersâ€™ behalf, it is possible to build workflow systems that bring further improvements in process automation and dynamic management, and achieve dynamic (re)allocation of resources to Actors. A WIBO prototype architecture has been implemented using Java. A Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) has been used to enable WIBOs to communicate over an Intranet or Internet.</abstract></paper>

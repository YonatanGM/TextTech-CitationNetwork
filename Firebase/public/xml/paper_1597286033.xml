In this paper, we describe our work as it evolved due to improvements in technology and our aggressive attitude toward scale. We discuss the types of features that our signatures contain, nuances of how these are updated through time, our treatment of outliers, and the trade-off between time-driven and event-driven processing. We provide a number of examples, all drawn from the application of signatures to toll fraud detection.</abstract></paper>

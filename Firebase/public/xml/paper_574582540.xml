Understanding the fluctuation of the IS faculty job market is a critical success factor for future planning and recruitment efforts. This paper presents the results of a longitudinal study that monitored the supply and demand of IS professors between 1992 and 2004. Data, primarily from the AIS and ICIS placement services, were analyzed to identify the trends in this market. Other relevant issues such as the composition of IS faculty position applicants, supply of IS doctorates, and trends in IS professor salary are also discussed. The paper concludes with recommendations to business and IS schools based on the findings. Explain what the findings were</abstract></paper>

The underlying idea is to randomize the first few and last few rounds of the cipher with independent masks at each round until all intermediate values depend on a large number of secret key bits, thereby disabling power attacks on subsequent inner rounds. We show how to combine differential cryptanalysis applied to the first few rounds of the cipher with power attacks to extract the secret key from intermediate unmasked (unknown). values, even when these already depend on all secret key bits. We thus invalidate the widely believed claim that it is sufficient to protect the outer rounds of an iterated block cipher against side-channel attacks.</abstract></paper>

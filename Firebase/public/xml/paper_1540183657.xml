It proposes non-metric measures for evaluating the similarity between: (a) two identical values in a feature, (b) two different values in a feature, (c) two objects. The paper suggests that similarity is dependent upon the context: It is influenced by the given set of objects, and the concept under discussion. The proposed Context-Similarity measure was tested, and the paper presents comparisons with other measures. The comparisons suggest that compared to other measures, the Context-Similarity suites best for natural concepts.</abstract></paper>

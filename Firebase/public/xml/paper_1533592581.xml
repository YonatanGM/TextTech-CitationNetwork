A number of problems in connection with pre- and postcondition specifications are discussed and solutions presented. Problems that are discussed include: framing, dynamic object creation, non-atomic actions and user-friendly syntax. The technique as described is part of the specification language COLD-1 and has been used in several industrial applications.</abstract></paper>

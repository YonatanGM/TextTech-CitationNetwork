An object is defined to be the “atomic patterns” in this Boolean Algebra, i.e. the elements which cover the least element. A description is a statement obtained from a set of basic predicates by the use of the usual logical connectives. Each basic predicate is true for one and only one element of one of the pre-defined partitions. If the partitions and their elements have names which are themselves objects in another Boolean Algebra, then complex patterns can often be described by comparatively simple statements which express relations in the universe of names. Examples have been given to show how the description language can be used to describe complex patterns in the “character-recognition” environment by comparatively simple statements.</abstract></paper>

A reference framework for process concepts and technology support is sought. The general requirements and properties of the process domain are first discussed. Then, four process sub-models are presented to describe activities, products, tools and organisations, respectively. Five process model phases are also introduced, as well as meta-processes and related human roles to handle process models and their transformations. The process concepts are applied to a bank example.</abstract></paper>

This article examines the issue of Information Systems (IS) core concepts; explores the content and boundaries of the Information Systems research domain; and discusses whether consensus about an identity and domain for Information Systems is important and worth discussing. Despite concerns in the profession about an IS identity crisis, Information Systems is a legitimate area of scientific research and inquiry. Groups like the Association for Information Systems are institutionalizing the IS domain of inquiry. Furthermore, Information Systems researchers are becoming much more assertive about the importance of the IS research domain.</abstract></paper>

Eliminating redundant interleavings can lead to significant savings of analysis effort. The theory behind the method is developed in an abstract framework. Elementary Petri nets and shared variable multi-process programs are then used as application examples. The relation of the method to other reduction methods is briefly discussed.</abstract></paper>

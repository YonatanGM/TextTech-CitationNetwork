However, the role of control objectives stemming from regulationsand standards is becoming increasingly important for businesses in light ofrecent events that led to some of the largest scandals in corporate history. Asorganizations strive to meet compliance agendas, there is an evident need toprovide systematic approaches that assist in the understanding of the interplaybetween (often conflicting) business and control objectives during businessprocess design. In this paper, our objective is twofold. We will firstly present aresearch agenda in the space of business process compliance, identifying majortechnical and organizational challenges. We then tackle a part of the overallproblem space, which deals with the effective modeling of control objectivesand subsequently their propagation onto business process models. Controlobjective modeling is proposed through a specialized modal logic based onnormative systems theory, and the visualization of control objectives onbusiness process models is achieved procedurally. The proposed approach isdemonstrated in the context of a purchase-to-pay scenario.</abstract></paper>

It is general because the enabling rules cater for true concurrency as well as an interleaving semantics and because it encompasses the other proposals for arc extensions that have been made recently in the Petri Net literature, often in the context of the requirements of specific application domains. It is systematic because it proposes a set of fundamental arcs in the context of a general complementary place construction and then considers how these arcs can be combined in arbitrary ways. Because of the utility of some of these compound arcs and the minimal overhead in implementing them, it is argued that CP-net tools should provide explicit support for them.</abstract></paper>

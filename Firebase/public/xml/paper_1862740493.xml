We construct a probabilistic public-key encryption scheme with the following properties: - It is easy to encrypt using the public keys of any subset of parties, such that it is hard to decrypt without the cooperation of every party in the subset. - It is easy for any private key holder to give a "witness" of its contribution to the decryption (e.g., for parallel decryption). - It is "blindable": From an encrypted bit it is easy for anyone to compute a uniformly random encryption of the same bit. - It is "xor-homomorpbic": From two encrypted bits it is easy for anyone to compute an encryption of their xor. - It is "compact": The size of an encryption does not depend on the number of participants.Using this joint encryption scheme as a tool, we show how to reduce the message complexity of secure computation versus a passive adversary (gossiping faults).</abstract></paper>

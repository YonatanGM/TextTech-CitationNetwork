Experimental comparison given on real-world data collected from Web users shows that characteristics of the problem domain and machine learning algorithm should be considered when feature scoring measure is selected. Our problem domain consists of hyperlinks given in a form of small-documents represented with word vectors. In our learning experiments naive Bayesian classifier was used on text data. The best performance was achieved by the feature selection methods based on the feature scoring measure called Odds ratio that is known from information retrieval.</abstract></paper>

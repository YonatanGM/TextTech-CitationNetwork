Certain patterns of distance and directional estimates collected from humans have been interpreted as being due to non-metric or non-Euclidean spatial knowledge. I argue that attempts to determine this geometry are inconsistent with existing theoretical models of human knowledge storage and use. Spatial estimation data are more parsimoniously explained as resulting from: (a) measurement error and ambiguity, (b) multiple and uncoordinated long-term memory representations, and (c) processes taking place when spatial knowledge is activated and used.</abstract></paper>

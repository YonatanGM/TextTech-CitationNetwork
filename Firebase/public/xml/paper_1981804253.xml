The creation of knowledge from information can be promoted by proper representations of information which make the inherent logical structure of the information transparent. Since concepts are the basic units of human thought and hence the basic structures of logic, the logical structure of information is based on concepts and concept systems. Therefore, concept lattices as mathematical abstraction of concept systems can support humans to discover information and then to create knowledge. The TOSCANA software even allows the navigation through a network of concept lattices and thereby information discovery in databases which may further lead to knowledge creation.</abstract></paper>

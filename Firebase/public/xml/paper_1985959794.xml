One explanation may be that this kind of information, while important, is too unstructured to be readily captured and retrieved. We report on a field study in which a simple structuring method (IBIS, for Issue-Based Information System) was used over an extended period of time to record and allow retrieval of a significant quantity of precisely this kind of information, using very simple technology. We draw some implications for hypertext and GroupWare, and for the prospect of supporting the design process with technology.</abstract></paper>

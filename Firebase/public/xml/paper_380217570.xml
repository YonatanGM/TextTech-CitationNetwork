Its principle is based on a duality between differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis, and applicable to various block ciphers. Then using this program, we observe how the order of S-boxes affects the strength of DES. We show that the order of the S-boxes is well-arranged against differential cryptanalysis, though it is not the best choice. On the other hand, our experimental results indicate that it is a very weak choice in regard to linear cryptanalysis. In other words, DES can be strengthened by just rearranging the order of the S-boxes.</abstract></paper>

Mobile commerce applications may present many interesting wireless infrastructure requirements. One such requirement is location management. In this paper, we discuss the location management requirements of different m-commerce applications, present a new methodology to model m-commerce requirements using a generic m-commerce application, and introduce a technique to evaluate the location management overhead of various m-commerce applications.</abstract></paper>

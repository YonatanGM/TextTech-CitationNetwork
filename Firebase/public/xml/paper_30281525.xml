Although, assuring an alignment between the technological developments with the business domain is a demanding task. With the purpose of clarifying the relations between the models that support the business and the software representations, we present in this paper a V-Model based approach to align the business domain requirements with the context for product design. This V Model encompasses the models that support the initial definition of the project goals, expressed through organizational configurations, and the analysis and design of models that result in a process-level perspective of the system’s logical architecture. Our approach adopts a process-level perspective with the intent to create context for product-level requirement elicitation. We present a case study as a demonstration and assessment of the applicability of our approach. Since the case study is extremely complex, we illustrate how to use the ARID method to evaluate the obtained process-level architecture.</abstract></paper>

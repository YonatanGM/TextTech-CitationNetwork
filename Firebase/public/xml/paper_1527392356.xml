Slices can be extracted particularly easily from a program representation called a program dependence graph, originally introduced as an intermediate program representation for performing optimizing, vectorizing, and parallelizing transformations. Such slices are of a slightly restricted form: rather than permitting a program to be sliced with respect to program point p and an arbitrary variable, a slice must be taken with respect to a variable that is defined at or used at p.</abstract></paper>

ADEPT offers sophisticated modeling concepts and advanced features, like temporal constraint management, ad-hoc WF changes, WF schema evolution, synchronization of inter-workflow dependencies, and scalability. We sketch these features and describe how they have been realized within ADEPT. In addition, we show which tools and interfaces are offered to developers and users in this context. ADEPT follows a holistic approach, i.e., the described concepts have not been implemented in an isolated fashion only, but are treated in conjunction with each other by integrating them within one WfMS.</abstract></paper>

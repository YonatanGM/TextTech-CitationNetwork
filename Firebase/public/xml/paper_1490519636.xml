Such environments, called process-centred, are characterised by their ability to provide some assistance or automatisation of the software process being carried out. This paper describes the ALF Meta-CASE environment developed in the framework of the ALF ESPRIT project. It consists of a formalism for modelling computer-assisted software processes and mechanisms for supporting the generation of process-centred CASE environments. These environments are able to enact formal software processes models and to assist developers during their enaction.</abstract></paper>

Mobile electronic commerce is today limited in size but future mobile networks will grow dramatically. In such environments, the participating nodes must be selforganized to collaboratively implement all the services a fixed network would provide. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a system that supports the development of adaptive electronic services. We focus our attention on the problem of transactional interaction between nodes, which is an essential requirement in electronic commerce. To support, this feature, our system allows us to dynamically incorporate the transactional support in mobile nodes and provides the foundation for a self-organizing transaction system. The paper discusses then how groups of collaborating nodes can execute electronic transactions on an infrastructure-less, ad-hoc environment. We conclude with a preliminary performance evaluation.</abstract></paper>

We claim two advantages for our model, which is admittedly more restrictive. First, our games have a more apparent resemblance to ordinary parlor games in spite of their infinite duration. Second, by distinguishing those nodes of the graph that determine the winning and losing of the game (winning-condition nodes), we are able to offer a complexity analysis that is useful in computer science applications.</abstract></paper>

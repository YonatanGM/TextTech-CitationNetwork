These requirements refer to the desired expressiveness of the formalism (such as representing continuous change) and to potential pitfalls (such as theinter- andintra-frame problems) that should be avoided. We “benchmark” some of the better known temporal formalisms that have been proposed in Artificial Intelligence by stating which of the requirements are met, in our opinion, by each formalism.</abstract></paper>

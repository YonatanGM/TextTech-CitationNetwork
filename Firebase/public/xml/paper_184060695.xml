While this approach generally works well in practice, there remains the problem of where to begin, especially if the designer does not have much experience. Based on limited field studies, we find that preferences for information, both in terms of the content and the format of the data, vary with decision focus (tactical vs. strategic), environmental stability, and, in some cases, experience. These results suggest that, if it is possible to determine the context and decision-maker attributes, it is possible to have a clearer notion of what information to include in the decision support system.</abstract></paper>

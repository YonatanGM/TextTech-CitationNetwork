That is, given a line or circular arc and a boundary made up of line segments and circular arcs, partition the given line or circular arc into the pieces that lie inside and those that lie outside the boundary. The algorithm works on nonself-intersecting polygonal boundaries. This problem arises in computer graphics, when a circular-arc polygon boundary is used as a window on a scene. It is also related to geometrical problems that arise in integrated circuit design.</abstract></paper>

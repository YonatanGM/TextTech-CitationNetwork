We consider the problem of determining for a given distribution P xyz whether Alice and Bob can in principle, by communicating over an insecure channel accessible to Eve, generate a secret key about which Eveu0027s information is arbitrarily small. When X, Y, and Z are random variables that result from a binary random variable being sent through three arbitrary independent channels, it is shown that secret key agreement is possible if and only if I(X;YÂ¦Z) u003e0, i.e., under the sole condition that X and Y have some (arbitrarily weak) statistical dependence when given Z.</abstract></paper>

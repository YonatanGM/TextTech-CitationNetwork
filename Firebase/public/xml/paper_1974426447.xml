However, it has not yet been incorporated in a development method for large systems. The approaches taken are merely extensions of well-known techniques when u0027programming in the smallu0027 and do not stand on the firm experience of existing developments methods for large systems. One such technique called block design has been used within the telecommunication industry and relies on a similar paradigm as object-oriented programming. The two techniques together with a third technique, conceptual modeling used for requirement modeling of information systems, have been unified into a method for the development of large systems.</abstract></paper>

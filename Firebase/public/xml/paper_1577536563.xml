In [32], annotations were extended to allow variables and functions, and it was argued that such logics can be used to provide a formal semantics for rule-based expert systems with uncertainty. In this paper, we continue to investigate the power of this approach. First, we introduce a new semantics for such programs based on ideals of lattices. Subsequently, some proposals for multivalued logic programming [5, 7, 18, 32, 40, 47] as well as some formalisms for temporal reasoning [1, 3, 41] are shown to fit into this framework. As an interesting byproduct of the investigation, we obtain a new result concerning multivalued logic programming: a model theory for Fittingu0027s bilattice-based logic programming, which until now has not been characterized model-theoretically. This is accompanied by a corresponding proof theory.</abstract></paper>

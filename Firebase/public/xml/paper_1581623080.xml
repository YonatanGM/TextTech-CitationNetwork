The paper propose a reverse approach to achieving flexibility, namely to start with chaos and then impose restrictions. This approach employs an untraditional view on business process which is regarded not as a “flow of work”, but as a trajectory in the space of all possible states. The execution control in the proposed approach is realized via the notion of valid state, were a state includes activities currently planned for the given process. The flexibility is achieved by breaking the rules of planning into three categories: obligations, prohibitions, and recommendations.</abstract></paper>

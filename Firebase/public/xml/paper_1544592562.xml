The feature of this scheme is to allow a central broadcast site to broadcast secure transmissions to an arbitrary set of recipients. In this paper we model the problem of unconditionally secure broadcast encryption schemes with an information theoretic framework. We obtain tight limitations both on the number of private keys associated with each user and on the number of keys generated by the center. Finally, we consider the model where interaction is allowed in the common key computation phase proving that the interaction cannot help in decreasing the size of the pieces of information given to the users in the broadcast encryption schemes.</abstract></paper>

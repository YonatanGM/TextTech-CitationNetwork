We argue that an open multiagent system should define the following support elements for agent :[48],"common set of speech acts to define the types of messages that an agent might send to another :[48],"common :[67],"service ontology by which the agents can describe their capabilities to each other, and reason about which agents have the capabilities needed to execute specific :[48],"common set of :[94],"prescriptive conversation policies to define the acceptable exchanges of messages between agents.</abstract></paper>

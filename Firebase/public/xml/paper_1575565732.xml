However, ISD is a complex activity, which requires well selected and suited methodologies and development practices for different situations. This calls for CASE shells (metaCASE environments) in which the methodologies can be tailored. Further, the quality of produced deliverables (e.g. specifications and models) is dependent on the development process. The focus of this paper is on integrating a flexible process support into a CASE shell. The ISD process is specified using a graphical process model, the purposes of which are the guidance and coordination of various activities, and the management of the IS deliverables produced during the development. In this paper process modeling requirements are discussed, and the methodology engineering — especially the process modeling — process using a CASE shell is described.</abstract></paper>

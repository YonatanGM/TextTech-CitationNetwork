As a step toward a more complete metatheory of Lamportu0027s axiom system, this paper determines the extent to which that system differs from systems based on “atomic,” or indivisible, actions. Theorem 1 shows that only very weak conditions need be satisfied in addition to the given axioms to guarantee the existence of an atomic “model,” while Proposition 1 gives sufficient conditions under which any such model must be a “faithful” representation. Finally, Theorem 2 restates a result of Lamport showing exactly when a system can be thought of as made up of a set of atomic events that can be totally ordered temporally. A new constructive proof is offered for this result.</abstract></paper>

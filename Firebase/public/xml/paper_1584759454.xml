Walter and Thompson assumed that the attacked device uses a particular table method combined with Montgomeryu0027s algorithm. In the present paper their attack is optimized and generalized. For 2- bit tables this leads to a reduction of the necessary sample size to 20 per cent. The original attack cannot be applied if 4-bit tables are used,a case of particular practical interest, whereas the optimized attack gets by with 500 measurements. The optimized version can straightforwardly be adapted to other table methods,other multiplication algorithms and inexact timings. Moreover,it is shown that the countermeasures proposed in [9] do not prevent the optimized attack if unsuitable parameters are chosen.</abstract></paper>

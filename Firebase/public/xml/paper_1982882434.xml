In order to develop techniques for this partitioning of a logic network we have considered the following problem: Given an acyclic combinational network composed of various primitive blocks such as NOR gates, assume that a maximum of M gates can be "clustered" together into larger modules, and that a maximum of P pins can be accommodated in each larger module. Assume also that in a network composed of such larger modules, no delay is encountered on the interconnections linking two gates internal to a module and a delay of one time unit is encountered on interconnections linking two gates in different modules . Find an easily applied algorithm that will result in a network such that the maximum delay through the network is minimized.</abstract></paper>

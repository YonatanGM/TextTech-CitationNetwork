This logic subsumes most existing first-order logics of programs that manipulate their environment, including Floydu0027s and Hoareu0027s logics of partial correctness and Manna and Waldingeru0027s logic of total correctness, yet is more closely related to classical first-order logic than any other proposed logic of programs. We consider two issues: how hard is the validity problem for the formulae of dynamic logic, and how might one axiomatize dynamic logic? We give bounds on the validity problem for some special cases, including a P 0 2 -completeness result for the partial correctness theories of uninterpreted flowchart programs. We also demonstrate the completeness of an axiomatization of dynamic logic relative to arithmetic.</abstract></paper>

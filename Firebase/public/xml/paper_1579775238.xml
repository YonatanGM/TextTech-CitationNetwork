This paper describes the basic design of the component architecture, as well as some of the particular component instances that constitute the latest release of LAM/MPI. Performance comparisons against the previous, monolithic, version of LAM/MPI show no performance impact due to the new architectureâ€”in fact, the newest version is slightly faster. The modular and extensible nature of this implementation is intended to make it significantly easier to add new functionality and to conduct new research using LAM/MPI as a development platform.</abstract></paper>

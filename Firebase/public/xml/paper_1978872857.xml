This paper addresses the issue of processing data that have been encrypted while the data are in an encrypted mode. It develops a new approach for encryption models that can facilitate the processing of such data. The advantages of this approach are reviewed, and a basic algorithm is developed to prove the feasibility of the approach.</abstract></paper>

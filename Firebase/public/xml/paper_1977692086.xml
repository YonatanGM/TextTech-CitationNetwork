MRPPS is an interactive system which gives the user the ability to create and maintain a core-bound data base and to input queries either as well-formed formulas in the first-order predicate calculus or as clauses. MRPPS consists of three basic components: (1) a set of inference rules for making logical deductions, many of which are based on the resolution principle; (2) a search strategy for heuristically determining the sequence in which to select base clauses and to perform deductions on clauses already generated; and (3) a base clause selection strategy that uses heuristic and semantic information for determining which data axioms and general axioms are to be brought to bear on the problem. These three components are described and MRPPS is compared to related work.</abstract></paper>

To make our system appealing and useful, we require it to have the following properties: (i) data only from a single body location needed, and it is not required to be from the same point for every user; (ii) should work out of the box across individuals, with personalization only enhancing its recognition abilities; and (iii) should be effective even with a cost-sensitive subset of the sensors and data features. In this paper, we present an approach to building a system that exhibits these properties and provide evidence based on data for 8 different activities collected from 12 different subjects. Our results indicate that the system has an accuracy rate of approximately 90% while meeting our requirements. We are now developing a fully embedded version of our system based on a cell-phone platform augmented with a Bluetooth-connected sensor board.</abstract></paper>

While still considered by some to be merely a technological phenomenon, it also includes organisational changes in public administration, development and implementation of new business processes, discovering better and faster ways of providing public services and offering entirely new services, not known before. In this article we try to look at the development of e-government in Slovenia from both perspectives, technological and organisational. We explore the public administration presence on the Internet, the services it provides and the back-office systems that support them. The current state of electronic services provided by various public administration bodies is examined, both from the end useru0027s perspective and from a technological point of view. We present the current state of e-government with respect to the action plans it has committed itself, while relying on well-known methodology adopted by the European Commission.</abstract></paper>

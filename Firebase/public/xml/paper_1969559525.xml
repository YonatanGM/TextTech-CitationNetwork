A novel approach to determine possible IDAS functionality is described, and the results of focus groups conducted with older adults and care workers are reported. The paper identifies some difficulties encountered when using the focus group method with an ageing sample, and highlights the importance of careful preparatory work if this method is to be used successfully in such a context.</abstract></paper>

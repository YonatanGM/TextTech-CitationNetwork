The main result is a requirement on the consistency between the process of deriving an external view from the conceptual view and the translation of external (user) operations into conceptual operations.It is also shown that this requirement is not sufficient to characterize the "interference" arising from a shared use of a Data Base.Informal and formal examples illustrating these concepts are given.</abstract></paper>

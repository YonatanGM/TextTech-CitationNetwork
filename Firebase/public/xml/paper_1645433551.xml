We propose Anselm Straussu0027 (1993). Theory of Action as a candidate from which to evolve a framework to ground an understanding of work. Insights from Straussu0027 work on the importance of structural conditions for social world (cooperative ensemble) interactions can help us to view support systems in a new role as setting/locale for cooperative work interaction, thus providing a bridge between the social and the technical. We briefly overview a locales-based environment called WORLDS we are building concurrent with our theoretical exploration.</abstract></paper>

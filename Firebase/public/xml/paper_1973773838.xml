Yet, the literature contains no recent, large-scale, objective studies of appropriate publication mechanisms. Here, we employ a citation analysis methodology to (1) examine citation trends for books, proceedings, and journals, and (2) determine a relative ranking of journals concerned with this research. Five base journals were determined by results of previously reported ranking studies. Our data collection produced over 25,000 citations for the years 1987–1991. The journal rankings generated are compared with those of earlier studies, both objective and subjective. Together, these rankings are used to identify core members for two top tiers of journals with each ranking serving as a filter on tier membership.</abstract></paper>

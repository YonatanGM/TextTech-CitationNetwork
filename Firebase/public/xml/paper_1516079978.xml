The application concerns a safety critical system and for modelling the application domain two conceptual models, developed within the ESPRIT project TEMPORA, were used: the Entity Relationship Time (ERT) for the structural part and the Conceptual Rule Language (CRL) for constraints, derivation and event-action rules. The mapping from the conceptual level to the deductive DBMS platform, namely MegaLog, is described with some sample results. An overview of the system, along with a simple user interface for creating different application scenarios are presented and are followed by some statistic results of a real life case study and an evaluation of the proposed approach.</abstract></paper>

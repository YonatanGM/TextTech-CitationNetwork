Besides substantial advantages offered by these exchange sites, e-marketplaces do not work up to their full potential at the moment. This paper describes both a new business model and its technical implementation using Grid technology. A new, three-sided e-commerce model is suggested that integrates buyers, sellers and logistics service providers who all participate in the same negotiation process. To solve computation intensive optimisation tasks and to integrate back-office and marketplace applications, a Grid services based marketplace implementation model is outlined.</abstract></paper>

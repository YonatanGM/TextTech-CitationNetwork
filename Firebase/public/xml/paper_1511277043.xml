Association rules are intended to identify patterns of the type: “A customer purchasing item A often also purchases item B.” Motivated partly by the goal of generalizing beyond market basket data and partly by the goal of ironing out some problems in the definition of association rules, we develop the notion of dependence rules that identify statistical dependence in both the presence and absence of items in itemsets. We propose measuring significance of dependence via the chi-squared test for independence from classical statistics. This leads to a measure that is upward-closed in the itemset lattice, enabling us to reduce the mining problem to the search for a border between dependent and independent itemsets in the lattice. We develop pruning strategies based on the closure property and thereby devise an efficient algorithm for discovering dependence rules. We demonstrate our algorithm‘s effectiveness by testing it on census data, text data (wherein we seek term dependence), and synthetic data.</abstract></paper>

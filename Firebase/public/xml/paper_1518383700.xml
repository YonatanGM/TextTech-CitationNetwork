In these schemes, as well as in subsequent variants, both the prover and the verifier have to perform modular multiplications. This paper is an attempt to build identification protocols that use only very basic operations such as multiplication by a fixed matrix over the two-element field. Such a matrix can be viewed as the parity-check matrix of a linear binary error-correcting code. The idea of using error-correcting codes in this area is due to Harari [3] but the method that is described here is both simpler and more secure than his original design.</abstract></paper>

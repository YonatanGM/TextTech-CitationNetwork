A tool called sdlvalid , for the formal validation of specifications written in the CCITT language SDL, has been in routine usage in one development area since 1989. Use of validation within the constraints of the existing development methodology has met with some success, but the need to develop an integrated approach to large scale development and validation has been identified. The NewCoRe 1 project is developing an approach for the systematic application of formal methods for design and verification specifically for use in the context of large scale software development. We seek to integrate a controlled refinement approach with automated support for partial and full validation, and test generation.</abstract></paper>

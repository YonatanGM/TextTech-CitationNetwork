Playback Control and Copy-Once are described. The ‘ticket concept’ is presented to provide these functionalities. Although the ticket shows similarities with a digital signature, there are essential differences. For instance, the ticket allows typical modifications of the content, which are common practice in transmission, storage and presentation of video. The concept is part of a proposal currently under investigation for standardization of DVD/CPTWG copy control. This paper also compares the ticket concept with other solutions, such as embedding a secondary mark at the recorder and using a signature scheme.</abstract></paper>

The model has four dimensions: participation characteristics, system characteristics, system initiator, and the system development environment. Stages of the System Development Life Cycle are considered as a participation characteristics, task complexity as a system characteristics, and top management support and user attitudes as parts of the system development environment. The data are from a cross-sectional survey in Korea, covering 134 users of 77 different information systems in 32 business firms. The results of the analysis support the proposed model in general. Several implications of this for MIS managers are then discussed.</abstract></paper>

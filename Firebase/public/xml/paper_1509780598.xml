These fair protocols enable to remove the trust from the casino/lottery without resorting to another trusted third party, by allowing the user playing the game to participate in the generation of the specific run of the game. Furthermore, the user is able to verify the correctness of the execution of the game at the end of the run. On-line lotteries and on-line casinos have different properties and we address the needs of the two different types of games.</abstract></paper>

Due to this disparity in responding schools, ?he results are mixed. The topics covered by most schools have been covered in mis courses for a number of years. More recent topics such as strategic uses of mis, end-user computing, and artificial intelligence are foreseen for the future by some respondents, but they do not appear to have made inroads into the content of the graduate mis course.</abstract></paper>

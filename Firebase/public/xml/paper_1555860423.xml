Brands presented a very efficient off-line electronic cash scheme based on the representation problem in groups of prime order. In Crypto u002795 a very efficient off-line divisible e-cash scheme based on factoring Williams integers was presented by T. Okamoto. We demonstrate one efficient attack on Okamotou0027s scheme and two on Brandsu0027 scheme which allow users to mis-represent their identities and double-spend in an undetectable manner, hence defeating the most essential security aspect of the schemes. The attack on Brandsu0027 scheme (which we suspect, given his previous related results, was an inadvertent omission) is also applicable to T. Eng and T. Okamotou0027s divisible e-cash scheme (presented in Eurocrypt u002794) which uses Brandsu0027 protocols as a building block.</abstract></paper>

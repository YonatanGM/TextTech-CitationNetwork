This paper describes a practical solution called the key predistribution system (KPS, for short), which has been proposed by the present authors. On request, the KPS quickly brings a common key to an arbitrary group of entities in a network. Using the KPS, it is quite easy to construct an enciphered one-way communication system, as well as an enciphered two-way (interactive) communication system. For example, even in a very large public network, the KPS can be applied to realize a practical enciphered electronic mailing service directed to individuals. This paper presents secure and efficient realization schemes for the KPS. This paper also discusses the security issues and the variety of applications of them.</abstract></paper>

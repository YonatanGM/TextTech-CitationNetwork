Such a simplification of the goal function allows better task performance or improved behavior of associated learning. This is particularly relevant in empirical concept learning, where constructive induction is essential to learn hard concepts having many peaks. This analysis helps to unify current systems and suggests ways to improve their design.</abstract></paper>

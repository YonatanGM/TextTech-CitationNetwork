It is shown that determining who wins such a game if each player plays perfectly is very hard; in fact, if this game problem is solvable in polynomial time, then any problem solvable in polynomial space is solvable in polynomial time. This result suggests that the theory of combinational games is difficult.</abstract></paper>

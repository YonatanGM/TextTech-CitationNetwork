The key novelty is to extend structural analysis to include a hypothetical "pre-cover", from which the cover object is imagined to derive. Here, maximum likelihood detection is presented for three structural detectors. Although the algebraic derivation is long, and maximizing the likelihood function difficult in practice, conceptually the new detectors are reasonably simple. Experiments show that the new detectors are the best performers yet, very significantly so in the detection of replacement of multiple bit planes.</abstract></paper>

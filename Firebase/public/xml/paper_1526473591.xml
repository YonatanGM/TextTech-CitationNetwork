We assert that a DBMS can perform knowledge-based reasoning in addition to its other tasks. Specifically, we prove that OPS5 (chosen as a representative of KBSs) can be emulated by QBE. The creation of KBSs using a DBMS as an infrastructure may supply immediate solutions to many problems of current KBS environments, such as too large fact and/or rule bases to enable strictly main memory processing, recovery, concurrency control, etc. A potential drawback of the DBMS-based implementation is a reduced performance. A solution to this problem would be demonstrated by a working system whose performance would be similar to that of other implementations. As a step toward this goal, we describe suggestions for performance improvements.</abstract></paper>

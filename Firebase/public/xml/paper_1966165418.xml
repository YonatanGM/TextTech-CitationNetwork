As many of these applications require location tracking of products, users, and services, support for location management has become a major issue in m-commerce. Although some progress has been made in adding location support in business to consumer (B2C) m-commerce, very little work has been done towards addressing these issues in the business to business (B2B) environment. In this paper, we discuss location management and present a new location-aware framework for B2B m-commerce environment.</abstract></paper>

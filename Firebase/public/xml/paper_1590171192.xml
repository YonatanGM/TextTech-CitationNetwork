This notion is advantageous for the construction and analysis of systems because it can be used as a basis for building systems by composing compatible subsystems as well as for analysis by substituting equivalent subsystems. A method to determine whether two CE-systems behave equivalently on a given quasi-interface is presented, which essentially consists of appropriately reducing the case graphs to graphs which reflect those (parts of) processes which can be observed on the quasi-interface. Finally, definitions of interface and compatibility are introduced which could be a useful starting point for dealing with the design of a system as opposed to its implementation.</abstract></paper>

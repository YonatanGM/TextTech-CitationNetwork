A simialr phenomena occurs when we comsider concepts such as Z-completeness of Z-comtinuity. This suggests that in all these different cases we are really talking about Z same thing. In this paper we show that this is indeed the case by abstracting out the essential common properties of the different instantiations of Z and proving common theorems within the resulting abstract framework.</abstract></paper>

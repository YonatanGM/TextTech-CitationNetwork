This paper assumes an Internet-service scenario where objects that have not reported their position within a specified duration of time are expected to no longer be interested in, or of interest to, the service. Due to the possibility of many "expiring" objects, a highly dynamic database results. The paper presents an R-tree based technique for the indexing of the current positions of such objects. Different types of bounding regions are studied, and new algorithms are provided for maintaining the tree structure. Performance experiments indicate that, when compared to the approach where the objects are not assumed to expire, the new indexing technique can improve search performance by a factor of two or more without sacrificing update performance.</abstract></paper>

We show how a weakness in the protocol for undeniable signatures allows blackmailing of a signer of a undeniable signature, or several verifiers simultaneously to verify several signatures. Also, we discuss how multiple verifiers can be convinced about the correctness of a signature in similar protocols, like Designated Confirmer Signatures, although no blackmailing attack is found for here.</abstract></paper>

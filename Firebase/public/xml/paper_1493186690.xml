The importance of these vectors lies in their usefulness for analyzing net properties. The concept of minimal p-semiflow is known in the context of Mathematical Programming under the name "extremal direction of a cone". This connection highlights a parallelism between properties found in the domains of P/T nets and Mathematical Programming. The algorithms known in the domain of P/T nets for computing elementary semi-flows are basically a new rediscovery, with technical improvements with respect to type of problems involved, of the basic Fourier-Motzkin method. One of the fundamental problems of these algorithms is their complexity. Various methods and rules for mitigating this problem are examined. As a result, this paper presents two improved algorithms which are more efficient and robust when handling "real-life" Nets.</abstract></paper>

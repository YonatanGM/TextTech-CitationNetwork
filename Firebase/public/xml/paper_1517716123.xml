By illustrating similarities between the research streams of mis planning and organizational strategic planning, we derive three major guidelines from a critical review and evaluation of the progress made in the strategic research stream over the last decade. These are: (i) recognition of hierarchy of mis planning levels and corresponding hierarchy in mis planning benefits; (ii) specific attention to operationalization of constructs to ensure correspondence between theoretical conceptualization and empirical observation; and (iii) the adoption of an overarching research framework rooted in the contingency theory tradition. We hope that the discussion will stimulate researchersâ€™ attention toward developing a program of research on mis planning.</abstract></paper>

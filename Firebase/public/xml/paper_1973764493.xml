In our sense a channel is a collection of content which can be transparently delivered to end user communities at a chosen cost/performance point through a flexible, policy-based application of resources. Three key elements of this approach are focusing on collections of content, policy-based application of resources through replication, and transparent delivery to end users. The resulting architectural developments may be as important to the commodity Internet as to next generation applications.</abstract></paper>

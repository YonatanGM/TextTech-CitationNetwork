This ability to bias learning has a strong adaptive value, because it permits more effective induction and inductive reasoning. In this paper, we describe a mechanism for learning and using variability biases that was modeled after human abilities. We then demonstrate the functional advantages that humans may achieve by maintaining such information.</abstract></paper>

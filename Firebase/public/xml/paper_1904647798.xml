However, it has not been addressed in wireless and mobile networks even though these emerging networks are more prone to failure and loss of access than their wireline counterparts. We present several different architectures and methods that can be used in designing survivable wireless networks. We also investigate issues related to end-to-end availability of service for wireless users.</abstract></paper>

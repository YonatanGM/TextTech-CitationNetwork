While some of them produce timed bisimilar models, others preserve only reachability or (weak) trace equivalence. We suggest a general framework for arguing when a translation preserves Timed Computation Tree Logic (TCTL) or its safety fragment. The framework works at the level of timed transition systems, making it independent of the modeling formalisms and applicable to many of the translations published in the literature. Finally, we present a novel translation from extended Timed-Arc Petri Nets to Networks of Timed Automata and using the framework argue that it preserves the full TCTL. The translation has been implemented in the verification tool TAPAAL.</abstract></paper>

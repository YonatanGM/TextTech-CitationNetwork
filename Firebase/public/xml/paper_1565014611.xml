The relevance of this comment to the subject matter of this paper is that it suggests that there may be a fourth independent coordinate in information authentication besides the three that will be discussed here. In spite of considerable effort, we have been unable to produce a convincing argument for or against this being the case, so we only mention the possibility for completeness.</abstract></paper>

In the possession of such knowledge, and with the revision of Oporto’s Municipal Master Plan taking place soon, the municipality is making an effort to develop an electronic citizen service that will allow a large number of citizens to consult it, and more important, participate in its public discussion prior to approval thus creating a major instrument of e-democracy in Oporto’s municipality.</abstract></paper>

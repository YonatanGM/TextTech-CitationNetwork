By using our schemes, an encryptor can encrypt data with a hidden access structure. A decryptor obtains her secret key associated with her attributes from a trusted authority in advance and if the attributes associated with the decryptoru0027s secret key do not satisfy the access structure associated with the encrypted data, the decryptor cannot decrypt the data or guess even what access structure was specified by the encryptor. We prove security of our construction based on the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption and the Decision Linear assumption. In our security notion, even the legitimate decryptor cannot obtain the information about the access structure associated with the encrypted data more than the fact that she can decrypt the data.</abstract></paper>

However, the precise relationship between cases and overall competence is a complex one. For example, some cases can be critical to competence, while others may be largely redundant. In this paper we present, and evaluate, a new model of case competence. We argue that this model has an important role to play in areas such as the evaluation and benchmarking of case-based techniques, and we demonstrate a novel application of the model as a guide to case-base designers during the case authoring process.</abstract></paper>

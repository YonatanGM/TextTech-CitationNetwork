Many of Compaqâ€™s customers need to employ threads to implement high-performance, scalable applications that address their needs in business and science. In order to ensure their success using threads, Compaq provides a runtime debugging and analysis tool for multithreaded applications called Visual Threads. This paper describes the automatic runtime checking for multithreaded applications incorporated in Visual Threads.</abstract></paper>

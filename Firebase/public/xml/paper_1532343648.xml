We argue that the deeper reason for a failure may be detected by computing certain subqueries of the useru0027s query. We introduce a query language based on the relational calculus and show how the subqueries are inferred from a failing query which is expressed in this language. Moreover we demonstrate how a certain class of integrity constraints may be used to augment the procedure which is employed to compute an informative answer to a failing query. The method is a good means to clear the dialog between a user and the data base from unnecessary queries.</abstract></paper>

These nets are schemes of ‘ordinary’ Petri nets. The places (circles) of Pr/T-nets represent changing properties of, or relations between, individuals; they are ‘predicates’ with variable extension. A current case of a system modelled by a Pr/T-net is denoted by marking the places with those tuples of individual symbols for which the respective predicates hold in that case. The transitions (boxes) are schemes of elementary changes of markings constituting the processes carried by the system. Instances of these schemes are generated by means of consistent substitution of individual variables by symbols.</abstract></paper>

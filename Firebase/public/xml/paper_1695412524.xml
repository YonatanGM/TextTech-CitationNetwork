A case study in the area of e-democracy, a number of different types of information systems applications, is presented. These are discussed from three perspectives on knowledge, (cognitive, social, and critical), using an analytical framework that is based on some general direction in the area of knowledge management. The lesson of the case study is that full support from all these perspectives are needed to make IS an effective support to democratic processes. The analysis shows that it is not a technical problem, most types of support are readily available and in use. There is an insight in the area that success rests on a match between IS, understanding democratic processes, and peoples’ expectations. The trouble, it seems, is to convert this into a system development perspective. Here findings from knowledge management could provide support.</abstract></paper>

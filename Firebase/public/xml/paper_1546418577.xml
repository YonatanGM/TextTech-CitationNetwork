In this paper, we impose a simple structure on the sets of colors to allow variables in both graphs and productions. Instantiations are performed by graph morphisms. Using relative unification, we define the composition of rules and prove the Concurrency Theorem in this more general framework. By restricting our attention to rooted directed acyclic graphs, we can represent standard Term Rewriting with First order substitutions. One of the motivations for this study is the attempt to provide a description of the static behavior of Rule-Based Expert Systems.</abstract></paper>

Many computer tools have been developed that enable the machine to help human software developers. It would be preferable, and in the not too distant future it will be necessary, for the machine to actually take over a substantial part of software development. Automatic programming seeks to do this by moving the human developer up from the implementation level of programming (e.g. COBOL, where the human has to include such details as data and control structures), to a level of programming that is less specific, where it is left to the computer decide the best way to fill in implementation. This article provides a survey of current research and development in automatic programming and a discussion of future directions in this field.</abstract></paper>

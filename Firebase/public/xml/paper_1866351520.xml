Previously, an efficient construction of asymmetric public-key tracing scheme was also presented by Kurosawa and Desmedt, however, their scheme required the involvement of the third trusted party(s) known as agent(s). As far as we know, our scheme is the first concrete construction of a practical asymmetric public-key traitor tracing that does not rely on trusted agents. Moreover, our protocol contains other desirable features: (direct non-repudiation, full frameproof, and black-box traceability for asymmetric scheme) that the previous public-key traitor tracing schemes did not offer. In order to eliminate the dependencies of the trusted agents, we use a novel primitive, recently invented by Naor and Pinkas called, "oblivious polynomial evaluation".</abstract></paper>

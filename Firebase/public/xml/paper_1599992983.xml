The proposed data hiding method embeds data to a block of input data (for example, image pixels, wavelet or DCT coefficients, etc.) by modifying some coefficients in a block in order to null the syndrome of the BCH coding. The proposed data hiding method can hide the same amount of data with less computational time compared to the existed methods. Contributions of this paper include the reduction of both time complexity and storage complexity as well. Storage complexity is linear while that of other methods are exponential. Time complexity of our method is almost negligible and constant for any n. On the other hand, time complexity of the existing methods is exponential. Since the time complexity is constant and storage complexity is linear, it is easy to extend this method to a large n which allows us to hide data with small embedding capacity. Note that small capacities are highly recommended for steganography to survive steganalysis. The proposed scheme shows that BCH syndrome coding for data hiding is now practical ascribed to the reduced complexity.</abstract></paper>

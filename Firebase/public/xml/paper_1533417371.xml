Although we can utilize powerful scientific methods such as model checking techniques to develop reliable embedded software, it is expensive to apply these methods to consumer embedded software development. In this paper, we propose an application of model checking techniques for design verification in product line development (PLD). We introduce reusable verification models in which we define variation points, and we show how to define traceability among feature models, design models and verification models. The reuse of verification models in PLD not only enables the systematic design verification of each product but also reduces the cost of applying model checking techniques.</abstract></paper>

Process stages, however, involve multiple issues, and it is unlikely that all issues are equally important for good performance at a stage. This article attempts to identify generic implementation issues á¾¢ those issues which arise at many process stages. An empirical analysis identified such issues, and suggested that three of them were quite important for differentiating between successful and unsuccessful MIS implementations.</abstract></paper>

This result implies the possibility of Euclidean reconstruction from a series of images with a moving camera, or equivalently, Euclidean structure-from-motion from an uncalibrated camera. No tractable algorithm for implementing their methods for more than three images have been previously reported. This paper gives a practical algorithm for Euclidean reconstruction from several views with the same camera. The algorithm is demonstrated on synthetic and real data and is shown to behave very robustly in the presence of noise giving excellent calibration and reconstruction results.</abstract></paper>

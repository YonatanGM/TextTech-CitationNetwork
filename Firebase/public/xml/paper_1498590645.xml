Under cryptographic assumptions, we give a general technique for achieving this goal for every problem in NP. This extends to a presumably larger class, which combines the powers of non-determinism and randomness. Our protocol is powerful enough to allow Alice to convince Bob of theorems for which she does not even have a proof: it is enough for Alice to convince herself probabilistically of a theorem, perhaps thanks to her knowledge of some trap-door information, in order for her to be able to convince Bob as well, without compromising the trap-door in any way.</abstract></paper>

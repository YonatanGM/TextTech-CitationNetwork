One of them has been proved in Andreka and Mikulas [3], and the others are new, though also closely related to some results in [3]. The main novelty of this paper is a simple method of proof, based upon a construction of canonical models for Lambek calculi by means of labeled formulas, whereas [3] uses graph-theoretic constructions. We handle labeled formulas in a way similar to Kurtonina [15] and the second author [14], but we make no use of Labeled Deductive Systems, which is an essential simplification.</abstract></paper>

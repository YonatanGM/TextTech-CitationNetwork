Nevertheless, some serious problems became apparent in the original Statecharts formalism so that many different Statecharts variants were proposed to overcome them. These problems are thoroughly described and approaches for solving them are evaluated. Furthermore, a set of distinctive features is elaborated which is used for a detailed comparison of the Statecharts variants. Finally, the feature set is used to characterize a new hypothetical Statecharts variant.</abstract></paper>

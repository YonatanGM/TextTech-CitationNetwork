This sub-area is now entering a new level of maturity by beginning to address the reuse aspects in the ERP RE process. The present article makes a first contribution to applied ERP requirements reuse measurement by incorporating reuse metrics planning as part of the implementation of metrics on an ERP project. Relevant process integration issues are tackled in the context of SAP R/3 implementation projects.</abstract></paper>

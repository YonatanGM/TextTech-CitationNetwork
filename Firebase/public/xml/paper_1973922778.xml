The data nodes are multibucket nodes that are accessed by hashing. In this paper we present two important improvements to the BD organization as originally described. First, records in a data node that overflow their designated primary bucket are stored in a single overflow bucket which is itself a bucket of the data node. Second, when file space needs to be increased, partial expansions are used that employ elastic buckets. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate that this variant of the BD organization has utilization, random access performance, and file growth performance that can be competitive with good extendible hashing methods, while supporting high-performance sequential access. The simplicity of the organization results in simple algorithms for realizing the organization.</abstract></paper>

They forced the view of dividing the overall problem solver into a component solely concerned with the domain rules and a component solely concerned with recording the state of the search. These systems seemed to be exclusively devoted to keeping a consistent database. Assumption-based Truth Maintenance (ATMS) extended this view and introduced the capability to handle multiple contexts simultaneously. This paper shortly reviews the motivations for TMS. Then the ATMS terminology is introduced and the Basic ATMS is described. Finally, some extensions to the Basic ATMS are given.</abstract></paper>

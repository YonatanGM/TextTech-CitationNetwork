The octree model, as well as several generalizations (polytrees, integrated polytrees, extended octrees), is specially well suited for these algorithms and can be used either as a primary or as a secondary model in solid modeling systems. This paper is concerned with a precise definition of the extended octree model that allows the representation of nonmanifold objects with planar faces and, consequently, is closed under Boolean operations on polyhedrons. Boolean nodes and nearly vertex nodes are introduced, and the model is discussed in comparison with related representations. A fast algorithm for the direct generation of the extended octree from the geometry of the base polygon in extrusion solids is presented, and its complexity is studied. Boolean operation algorithms are introduced.</abstract></paper>

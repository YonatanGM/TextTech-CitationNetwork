The contribution of this paper is twofold; • Whereas in [del Val and Shoham, 1992] we only showed that our encoding of the update problem satisfied the KM postulates, here we use an independently motivated generalization of the theory of action used in that paper to provide a one-to-one correspondence between our construction and KM update semantics. • We show how the KM semantics can be generalized by relaxing our construction in a number of ways, each justified in certain intuitive circumstances and each corresponding to one specific postulate. It follows that there are reasonable update operators outside the KM family.</abstract></paper>

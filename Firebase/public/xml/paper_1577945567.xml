For the display of such objects, both the visibility problem and the problem of combining the primitive solids into one composite object have to be solved. Recently, several CSG hidden surface algorithms have been published that reduce these two problems to a combination of simple depth comparisons and logical operations at the pixel level that can be performed in VLSI hardware display systems. An overview of these algorithms is given. Furthermore, a CSG depth-buffer algorithm is presented that combines these algorithms.</abstract></paper>

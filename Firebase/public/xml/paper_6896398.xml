However, the existing component development methodologies do not provide a clear standard for component identification and depend on the intuition and experience of individual developers. As a result, people with limited expertise cannot easily identify components. This paper proposes methods to identify components based on object-oriented techniques including Use Case diagrams, Class diagrams, and Sequence diagrams. We use two distinct steps in identifying components, that is, system and business component identification. In particular, our proposal considers dynamic dependency characteristics of the method call types and directions. Case study and assessment with the existing identification approaches help to verify the practicality of our proposal.</abstract></paper>

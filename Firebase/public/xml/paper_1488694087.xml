Traditional approaches fail when the features common to three consecutive views are all located on a plane. This happens because in the uncalibrated case there is a fundamental ambiguity in relating the structure before and after the plane. This is, however, a situation that is often hard to avoid in man-made environments. We propose a complete approach that detects the problem and defers the computation of parameters that are ambiguous in projective space (i.e. the registration between partial reconstructions only sharing a common plane and poses of cameras only seeing planar features) till after self-calibration. Also a new linear self-calibration algorithm is proposed that couples the intrinsics between multiple subsequences. The final result is a complete metric 3D reconstruction of both structure and motion for the whole sequence. Experimental results on real image sequences show that the approach yields very good results.</abstract></paper>

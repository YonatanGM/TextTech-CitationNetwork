Based on data collected in a laboratory setting, we examined differences among electronic mail, audio, and audio/video media in terms of message comprehension and perceived difficulty. Twenty-four volunteer business administration faculty and graduate students were subjects for the repeated-measures experiment. The results show that media affects message comprehension, but does not alter the recipientâ€™s perception of the difficulty of the message. Media that require reading the message were found to be superior to audio media in terms of comprehension.</abstract></paper>

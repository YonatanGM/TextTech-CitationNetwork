This generalization of the well-known pumping lemma (also called Bar-Hillelu0027s lemma, uvwxy lemma etc.) for context-free Chomsky languages is formulated and proved, where the iteration of LINK in the chain gluing leads to the pumping effect. The proof is based in canonical derivations and the embedding theorems studied in the algebraic theory of graph grammars.</abstract></paper>

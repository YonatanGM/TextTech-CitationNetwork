Winston is built using the design/OA™ Development System and hence inherits all the graphics capabilities of design. Winston supports the development of hierarchically structured networks of processes, in which networks of communicating processes may be decomposed recursively into subnetworks. A system specification created using Winston can be studied through multi-level simulation, and by analysis tools which include efficient pro­cedures for deciding Milner’s strong and weak observational equivalence between Finite State Processes.</abstract></paper>

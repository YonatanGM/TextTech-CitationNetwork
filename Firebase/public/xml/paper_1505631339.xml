In particular, the problems of design and implementation verification were identified as amenable to formal techniques and a number of well-motivated areas for research were identified. These to :[48],"discipline human reasoning during the generation of an rt1 or behavioral-level :[61],"semantics for synthesizable subsets of existing hardware-design languages such as VHDL and methods for :[74],"specification which are intuitive and easy to :[84],"means for expressing properties of integrated methods for :[91,98],"verifying properties of integrated methods for :[91,98],"verifying that an rt1 representation is consistent with a behavioral-level :[111],"robust methods for :[91,98],"verifying that two sequential circuits are equivalent.</abstract></paper>

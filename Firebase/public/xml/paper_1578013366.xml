We propose concrete, essentially optimal constructions for practical use, Chain-Shift (CS) and Chain-Rotate (CR), and prove their security. They are superior to the best previously known construction, the NI-construction proposed by An and Bellare: Only one rather than two secret keys are required, the efficiency is improved, and the message space is truly AIL, i.e., there is no upper bound on the message length. The generality of our proof technique is also illustrated by giving a simple security proof of the NI-construction and several improvements thereof.</abstract></paper>

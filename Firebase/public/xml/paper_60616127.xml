Moreover, there exists a satelite broadcasting random bits at a very low signal power. Alice and Bob can receive these bits with certain bit error probabilities ?A and ?B, respectively (e.g. ?A = ?B = 30%) while Eve is assumed to receive the same bits much more reliably with bit error probability ?E ? ?A, ?B (e.g. ?E = 1%). The errors on the three channels are assumed to occur at least partially independently. Practical protocols are discussed by which Alice and Bob can generate a secret key despite the facts that Eve possesses more information than both of them and is assumed to have unlimited computational resources as well as complete knowledge of the protocols.The described scenario is a special case of a much more general setup in which Alice, Bob and Eve are assumed to know random variables X, Y and Z jointly distributed according to some probability distribution PXYZ, respectively. The results of this paper suggest to build cryptographic systems that are provably secure against enemies with unlimited computing power under realistic assumptions about the partial independence of the noise on the involved communication channels.</abstract></paper>

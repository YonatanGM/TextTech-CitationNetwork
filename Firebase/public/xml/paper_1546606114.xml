A strategic data model is used to help coordinate investments across these types of management support systems. This extended methodology should enhance the validity of an information systems (is) planning effort because of both the scope of management support systems that are considered and the potential use of the assumptions to reassess and reexamine the soundness of the original CSFS. An actual planning engagement is used to illustrate the application of the methodology.</abstract></paper>

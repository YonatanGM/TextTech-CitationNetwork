It is emerging as one of the fastest growing disciplines in information technology. It is essential to correctly and effectively capture the workflow specific requirements of business information systems before their deployment through workflow management systems. In this paper, we look at different issues in capturing such requirements and propose a systematic layered modeling approach. We split the workflow specification requirements into five basic dimensions: structure, data, execution, temporal, and transactional. The concepts introduced in this paper have been applied as a foundation to the development of a workflows modeling and verification tool, FlowMake.</abstract></paper>

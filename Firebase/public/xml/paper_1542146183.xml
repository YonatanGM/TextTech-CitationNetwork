Compared with the node splitting algorithm that requires quadratic time and is used in most implementations of R-tree, it is more superior in terms of the time required to split a node, the distribution of data after splitting, as well as the area of overlapping. Most important of all, it has a better query performance. The claim is substantiated by an analysis of the algorithm and a set of empirical results.</abstract></paper>

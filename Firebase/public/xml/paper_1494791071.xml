The principle finding is the identification of several generic models which reveal the driving forces for new technology adoption. The article also describes phases in the adoption process, organizational roles, and information gathering mechanisms. This new line of research in MIS parallels and builds upon technology transfer research and marketing studies in the area of organizational buying behavior. The purpose of this work is to assist organizations with the challenge of coping with rapidly changing information technology.</abstract></paper>

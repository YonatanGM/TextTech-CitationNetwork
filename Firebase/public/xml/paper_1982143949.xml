Various results on who can help whom have been obtained on sets in BPP, in R, in UP and sparse sets. Sets which do not help any set are studied and two types of sets defined by structural properties are demonstrated to help no sets except those in P. Sest which help themselves are also studied and are shown to be related to self-reducible sets. Several previously known structural results on NP sets are reproved from the point of view of helping.</abstract></paper>

The problems are taken from nine different logic calculi: three versions of the two-valued sentential calculus, the many-valued sentential calculus, the implicational calculus, the equivalential calculus, the R calculus, the left group calculus, and the right group calculus. Each problem was given to the theorem prover Otter and was run with at least three strategies: (1) a basic strategy, (2) a strategy with a more refined method for selecting clauses on which to focus, and (3) a strategy that uses the refined selection mechanism and deletes deduced formulas according to some simple rules. Two new features of Otter are also presented: the refined method for selecting the next formula on which to focus, and a method for controlling memory usage.</abstract></paper>

One important difference is in the assumptions regarding integrity. In business, it is assumed that a database has complete integrity during all quiescent periods. In engineering design, in contrast, integrity does not exist for a database until design is almost complete. In a previous paper, we developed a revised definition of transaction that explicitly allows partial integrity. A management scheme, called entity state transaction management, was proposed that deals with both the partial ordering of transactions and the contention for shared information resources. The extension of this technique for application to large engineering problems is explored in this paper, with the development of a significant example.</abstract></paper>

TPIE, a transparent parallel I/O environment, is a system designed to assist programmers in implementing I/O-efficient computations. It supports I/O-efficient paradigms for problems from a variety of domains, including sorting and permuting, computational geometry, graph algorithms, and scientific computation. Our main focus in on the algorithmic issues faced in designing the portions of TPIE that support scientific computation. We consider four computing paradigms: scanning, sorting, sparse matrix methods, and dense matrix methods. Benchmark results using TPIE are also briefly described. References to more detailed discussions of these benchmarks, as well as the overall goals, philosophy, and structure of TPIE are provided.</abstract></paper>

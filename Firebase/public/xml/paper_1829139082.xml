The amount of perceived impact of environmental variables, task variables and personal characteristics of project team members on systems success was explored. Results demonstrate that project team members are concerned with group process issues as well as with technical issues within the ranks of the project team. The sobering finding in their responses was that information systems personnel perceive neither management support nor user involvement as critical to the successful development of systems.</abstract></paper>

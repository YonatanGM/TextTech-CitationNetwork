KeeLoq is inexpensive to implement and economical in gate count, yet according to Microchip [33] it should have "a level of security comparable to :[54],"this paper we present several distinct attacks on KeeLoq, each of them is interesting for different reasons. First we show that when about 232known plaintexts are available, KeeLoq is very weak and for example for 30% of all keys the full key can be recovered with complexity of 228KeeLoq encryptions. Then we turn our attention to algebraic attacks with the major challenge of breaking KeeLoq given potentially a very small number of known :[128],"best "direct" algebraic attack can break up to 160 rounds of KeeLoq. Much better results are achieved in combination with slide attacks. Given about 216known plaintexts, we present a slide-algebraic attack that uses a SAT solver with the complexity equivalent to about 253KeeLoq encryptions. To the :[128],"best of our knowledge, :[54],"this is the first time that a full-round real-life block cipher is broken using an algebraic attack.</abstract></paper>

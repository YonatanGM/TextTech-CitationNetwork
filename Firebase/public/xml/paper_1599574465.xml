A population-sizing equation is derived to ensure that minimum signal-to-noise ratios are favorable to the discrimination of the best building blocks required to solve a problem of bounded deception. In five test problems of varying degrees of nonlinearity, nonuniform scaling, and nondeterminism, the sizing relation proves to be a conservative predictor of average correct convergence. These results suggest how the sizing equation may be viewed as a coarse delineation of a boundary between two distinct types of GA behavior. Besides discussing a number of extensions of this work, the paper discusses how these results may one day lead to rigorous proofs of convergence for recombinative GAs operating on problems of bounded deception.</abstract></paper>

We propose instead the MD/PV model of spatial reasoning, which combines the power of diagrams with qualitative representations Next we propose connectivity as the organizing principle for kinematic state, and describe a set of basic inferences which every QK system must make. The frameworku0027s utility is illustrated by considering two programs, one finished and one in progress We end by discussing the research questions this framework raises.</abstract></paper>

Attention is chiefly directed to Electronic Service Delivery. If the promise of e-Government as the principal key to modernising government is to be kept, this concept has to be broadened so as to include the full enabling potential of IT, as well as the complex reality of government and public governance. There is encouraging political support for e-Government, yet implementation problems could inhibit further success.</abstract></paper>

Unfortunately, development methodologies have traditionally been inspired by programming concepts, not organizational ones, leading to a semantic gap between the system and its environment. To reduce as much as possible this gap, this paper proposes a development methodology named Tropos which is founded on concepts used to model early requirements. Our proposal adopts the i* organizational modeling framework [18], which offers the notions of actor, goal and (actor) dependency, and uses these as a foundation to model early and late requirements, architectural and detailed design. The paper outlines Tropos phases through an e-business example. The methodology seems to complement well proposals for agent-oriented programming platforms.</abstract></paper>

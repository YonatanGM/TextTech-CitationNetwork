We propose a technique to control such a deduction in a goal directed way: Comparing conclusion and hypothesis we obtain a syntactical pattern which has to be satisfied by each intermediate result of the deduction. To maintain this restriction we present a notion of terms and equations called C-terms resp. C-equations which we use as well to extend existing tactics for proof plans as to introduce new tactics.</abstract></paper>

For Information Systems, an ongoing debate focuses on defining the field narrowly versus broadly. Defining the field narrowly, as called for by Benbesat and Zmud’s nomological core [2003] is compelling because it distinctly defines what is IS research and what is not. Those who find the distinctness of IS lacking may find this a pragmatic solution. However, the narrow definition excludes a large portion of the IS community and their research. Alter’s [2003] Systems in Organizations proposal broadly defines the IS discipline in an inclusive way that embraces our historic diversity and makes IS distinct too.</abstract></paper>

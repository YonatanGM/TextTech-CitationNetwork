This paper considers a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) where binary quantitative constraints in terms of different time granularities can be specified on a set of variables, and unary constraints are allowed to limit the domain of variables. Such a CSP cannot be trivially reduced to one of the known CSP problems. The main result of the paper is a complete algorithm for checking consistency and finding a solution. The complexity of the algorithm is studied in the paper under different assumptions about the granularities involved in the CSP, and a second algorithm is proposed to improve the efficiency of the backtracking process needed to obtain all the solutions of the work of :[126],"Wang and Jajodia was partially supported by the National Science Foundation under the grant IRI-9633541.</abstract></paper>

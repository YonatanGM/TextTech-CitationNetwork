The proposed notion of specification is based on the observation, due to Winskel, that while some assertions are preserved across morphisms of labelled transition systems, other are reflected. The distinction between these two classes of assertions leads us to the definition of two categories of specifications, one that supports horizontal structuring and another that supports vertical structuring, for which compositionality is proved.</abstract></paper>

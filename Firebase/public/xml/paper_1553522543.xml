They are given by a transition graph modelling the control flow and partial algebras and method expressions modelling the data states and their transformations. According to this two-level structure they cover both labelled transition systems and rule based specification approaches, corresponding to information, computation and engineering viewpoint models. Different composition operations for algebra transformation systems are investigated. Limits and colimits model parallel and sequential composition of components, signature morphisms yield appropriate syntactical support for such compositions. The most important compositionality properties known from algebraic specification, like colimits of signatures and amalgamation of models, also hold for the framework of algebra transformation systems.</abstract></paper>

We investigate a structure to represent a class of problems that are slowly changing with respect to the viewer. A hierarchical structure for both time and the events associated with time is proposed. The concept of persistence for an event is introduced, and shown to be a useful tool for management and decision making. A simple linkage system is described which allows causal associations to be made between events. We conclude that this type of system is a useful addition to the current tools available for storage and representation of spatio-temporal concepts.</abstract></paper>

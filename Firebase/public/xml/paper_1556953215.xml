The fast correlation attack described by Meier and StatTelbach [1] on certain stream ciphers requires that the number of taps of the characteristic polynomial must be small, typically less than 10. The attack can be extended to characteristic polynomials with an arbitrary number of taps if an efficient algorithm is available to compute low-weight polynomial multiples of the feed-back polynomial. Given an arbitrary polynomial of degree k over GF(2), a method based on the "birthday paradox" was suggested in [1] to find weight-4 polynomial multiples of the polynomial having degree u003c 2 k/4. The computational complexity is O(2k/2), and a table size of O(2 k/2) is used. In this paper a technique based on Zechu0027s logarithm is described, which uses a significantly smaller table size but at the cost of increased computational complexity. It is shown that weight-4 polynomials of degree k can be found requiring a table size of O(2 k/3) and computational complexity O(2 k/3) + Dn[O(2k/3)], where the second term denotes the complexity to compute discrete logarithms in GF(2 k) of 0(2 k/3) field elements. If weight-4 polynomials of degree ~ 0(2 k/4) are required, the table size is 0(23k/s) and the computational complexity 0(23k/s) + DL[O(23k/s)]. To compute the discrete logarithm of field elements the use of Coppersmithu0027s algorithm [2] is suggested.</abstract></paper>

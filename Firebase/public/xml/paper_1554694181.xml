The proposed technique, which involves there cognition of cause and effect relationships, appears to provide three benefits. It aids in the identification of irrelevant data. It can be used to evaluate the factors that affect a given class of decisions. And, most importantly, it enhances the overall understanding of a decision makeru0027s environment, particularly when it is ill-structured. These observations are supported by a real world application of the approach to the evaluation of the performance of insurance claim representatives.</abstract></paper>

We present a minimum-cost maximum-flow based algorithm to compute the set of sites at which a user profile should be replicated given known calling and user mobility patterns. We show the costs and benefits of our replication algorithm against previous location lookup approaches through analysis. We also simulate our algorithm against other location lookup algorithms on a realistic model of a geographical area to evaluate critical system performance measures. A notable aspect of our simulations is that we use well-validated models of user calling and mobility patterns.</abstract></paper>

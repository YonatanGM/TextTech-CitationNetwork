This is not a task to be taken lightly, since it is a very difficult problem due to the mismatch between the useru0027s conceptualization of the data and its actual structure. By analyzing this problem in some detail we argue that this mismatch must be consciously resolved in a single process, and that the use of natural language instead of an artificial query language is the only means by which this can be done. The technical feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by the ROBOT natural language query processor. Actual dialogs and end user experiences are used to show the resulting increase in end user orientation. The impact of natural language processing on the various DBMS architectures is also discussed.</abstract></paper>

We asked each other questions like, "How many traffic lights are there along your usual route from the railroad station to your house?" Or, "Can a salt shaker be used as a stool?". The former type of question usually gives rise to introspective reports of a mental simulation of the traversal of the requested route, replete with visual imagery. The latter type of question may or may not give rise to a mental simulation. Some people report knowing propositlonally that a salt shaker cannot be used as a stool because its size is insufficient. Others report mentally playing through the motor sequence of sitting on a salt shaker, whence they rudely discover the negative answer.</abstract></paper>

Broadly speaking, two directions are currently being pursued: Applying cryptography to game theory: Certain game-theoretic equilibria are achievable if a trusted mediator is available. The question here is: to what extent can this mediator be replaced by a distributed cryptographic protocol run by the parties themselves? Applying game-theory to cryptography: Traditional cryptographic models assume some honest parties who faithfully follow the protocol, and some arbitrarily malicious players against whom the honest players must be protected. Game-theoretic models propose instead that all players are simply self-interested (i.e., rational), and the question then is: how can we model and design meaningful protocols for such a :[142],"addition to surveying known results in each of the above areas, I suggest some new definitions along with avenues for future research.</abstract></paper>

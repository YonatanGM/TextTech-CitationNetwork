KSDS defines type and structure of the elements of a conceptual net. KSDS generates the internal structure and format of the knowledge base. Nodes and relations of this net are structured in a uniform fashion, consisting of four parts: identification, description of attributes, relations to concepts, and explanations. For each attribute there exists a list of primitives which restricts its type and possible values. The relation part is constructed referencing already defined relations of the structure base. If the structure is changed, KSDS takes care of the re-formating of the knowledge base. The system is currently being used for the definition and maintalnance of the knowledge base of an expert system in primary medical care.</abstract></paper>

The number of association rules may be huge. In this paper, we define a cover operator that logically derives a set of association rules from a given association rule. Representative association rules are defined as a least set of rules that covers all association rules satisfying certain user specified constraints. A user may be provided with a set of representative association rules instead of the whole set of association rules. The association rules, which are not representative ones, may be generated on demand by means of the cover operator. In this paper, we offer an algorithm computing representative association rules.</abstract></paper>

Each party wants to expose as little of its input as possible to the other party. The authors prove tight bounds on the minimum amount of information about the individual inputs that must be revealed in the computation of most functions and of some specific ones. They also show that a computation that reveals little information about the individual inputs may require many more message exchanges than a more revealing computation. u003e</abstract></paper>

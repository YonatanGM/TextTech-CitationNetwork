If those curves exist and the heights of torsions are small, they can serve as a bridge for prime shifting, which results a nonuniform polynomial time algorithm to solve DDH on finite fields and a nonuniform subexpontial time algorithm to solve elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. At this time we are unable to prove the existence of those curves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply the ideas related to the Uniform Boundedness Theorem(UBT), formerly known as Uniform Boundedness Conjecture, in cryptography.</abstract></paper>

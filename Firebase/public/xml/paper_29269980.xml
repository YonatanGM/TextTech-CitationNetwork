This method is useful for attacking ciphers that use simple algebraic functions (in particular quadratic functions) as S-boxes. Also, attacks based on higher-order differentials are introduced. They are special and important cases of the interpolation attacks. The attacks are applied to several block ciphers, the six-round prototype cipher by Nyberg and Knudsen, which is provably secure against ordinary differential cryptanalysis, a modified version of the block cipher SHARK, and a block cipher suggested by Kiefer.</abstract></paper>

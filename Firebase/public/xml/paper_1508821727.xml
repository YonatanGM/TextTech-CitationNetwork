We give a detailed description of the formal model of the gear controller and its surrounding environment, and its correctness formalized according to the informal requirements delivered by our industrial partner of the project. The second contribution of this paper is a solution to the problem we met in this case study, namely how to use a tool like Uppaal, which only provides reachability analysis to verify bounded response time properties. The advantage of our solution is that we need no additional implementation work to extend the existing model-checker, but simple manual syntactical manipulation on the system description.</abstract></paper>

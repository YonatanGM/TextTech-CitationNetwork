While several proposals concerning the evaluation of costs and benefits exist, little attention has been given to the evaluation of technical qualities and, in general, to the “usage-oriented” issues. In this paper the existing proposals are examined, the different types of qualities and issues that are relevant to potential users are described, and a coherent and innovative method for the evaluation of OSS is proposed. The proposed method is expected to support the potential user in the evaluation and choice of OSS in a flexible way, taking into account all the aspects that are relevant to the user.</abstract></paper>

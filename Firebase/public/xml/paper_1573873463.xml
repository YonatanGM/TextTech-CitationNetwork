PROTEIN supports certain theorem proving calculi, such as restart model elimination and hyper tableaux, that are suitable for working with positive disjunctive logic programs. In particular, restart model elimination calculus is answer complete for postive queries. The DisLoP project started at this point with the aim of extending this further to minimal model reasoning and query processing wrt normal disjunctive logic programming too. The first phase of the project is complete and DisLoP can now perform minimal model reasoning with positive disjunctive logic programs, using both bottom-up and top-down strategies.</abstract></paper>

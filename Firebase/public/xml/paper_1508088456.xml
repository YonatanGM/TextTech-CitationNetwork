In software engineering, the OO approach as a design model, has been proven to produce quality software. It appears that GISs might also benefit from the OO approach. However, a GIS also imposes special (e.g. spatial) requirements, inclusion of which in the OO model has to be investigated. The proposed solution tries to meet these special requirements by incorporating two data structures: the R-tree and the Binary Line Generalization (BLG) tree. The latter is a novel data structure introduced in this document.</abstract></paper>

Since, in general, composing subnets does not preserve properties (especially liveness) at the level of the global net, the problem is to find constraints on the subnets for establishing such results. We have discovered that in some cases it is sufficient to put structural constraints (instead of constraints on the subnets languages) only on the medium, that is the subnet generated by the elements (places and transitions) shared by the two nets to be composed. Our theoretical study includes as media of communication: places (one way communication), a rendez-vous, a sequential process, and finally a well-formed block.</abstract></paper>

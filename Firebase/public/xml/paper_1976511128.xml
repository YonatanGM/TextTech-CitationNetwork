A simple language independent concept is put forward as a measure of control flow complexity in program text and is then developed for use as a measure of unstructuredness. The proposed metric is compared with other metrics, the most notable of which is the cyclomatic complexity measure. Some experience with automatic tools for obtaining these metrics is reported.</abstract></paper>

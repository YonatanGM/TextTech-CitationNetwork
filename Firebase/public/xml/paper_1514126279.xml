Current UK e-Government strategies indicate that such service access forms will be made available online. With the aging population considered as a primary user of these services this paper promotes the need to establish older adultsu0027 online form design requirements. Building on previous research [see 8], the current investigation validates and extends previous online form design requirements for an aging user group. The paper opens with an overview of current UK e-Government initiatives and promotes the investigation of older adultsu0027 online form design requirements, not only to assist this vulnerable user group with independent living but also to support social inclusion.</abstract></paper>

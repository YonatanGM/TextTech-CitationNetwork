Though many researchers and practitioners have implicitly assumed that data integration always results in net benefits to an organization, this article questions that view. Based on theories of organizational information processing, a model of the impact of data integration is developed that includes gains in organization-wide coordination and organization-wide decision making, as well as losses in local autonomy and flexibility, and changes in system design and implementation costs. The importance of each of these impacts is defended by theoretical arguments and illustrated by case examples. This model suggests that the benefits of data integration will outweigh costs only under certain situations, and probably not for all the data the organization uses. Therefore, MIS researchers and practitioners should consider the need for better conceptualization and methods for implementing "partial integration" in organization.</abstract></paper>

At the heart of the system there is a formalism well suited for representation of both processes and related domain knowledge. This language allows the semantic description of clinical processes using ontology and workflow representation formalisms. The main goal of the system is to assist in executing the clinical processes by providing intelligence functionalities, based on workflow mining techniques, and in monitoring processes during their execution. Acquired process instances can be analyzed to identify main causes of medical errors and high costs and, potentially, to suggest clinical processes restructuring or improvement able to enhance cost control and patient safety.</abstract></paper>

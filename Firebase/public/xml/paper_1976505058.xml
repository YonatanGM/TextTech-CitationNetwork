In this paper we report on efforts to develop a new methodology for needs assessment evaluation. We use the Critical Task Method to identify the “bottleneck cognitive tasks” of principals with an unstructured work profile. Data were collected on the computer-support needs of faculty researchers, and the findings indicate that a “knowledge-based” design offers the most promise for delivering effective support. In addition, the systems design suggests the integration of text, data, voice, and images.</abstract></paper>

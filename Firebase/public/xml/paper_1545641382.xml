In this paper, we proposed a novel three-tier color index that supports efficient image retrieval by color contents which is important to certain applications, especially when shapes and semantic objects cannot be easily recognized. A prototype painting database system is designed and implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed indexing technique. Besides the color index, two other indexes, B+-trees for structured attributes and a signature file for free-text descriptions, were also implemented. As a result, a wide range of queries, both text-based and content-based can be processed efficiently. We also look at existing image database systems based on their query retrieval capabilities.</abstract></paper>

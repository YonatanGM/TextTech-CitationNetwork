This situation contributes to the difficulty of predicting the run-time behavior of sets of rules: thus, ensuring the termination of a given set of rules is currently viewed as a major research issue. In this paper, we introduce a durable change semantics for active database rules; this semantics improves Starburstu0027s deferred activation notion with concepts taken from Postgres and Heraclitus and the semantic foundations of deductive databases. We provide a formal logic-based model for this transaction-oriented semantics, show that it is amenable to efficient implementation, and prove that it solves the non-termination problem.</abstract></paper>

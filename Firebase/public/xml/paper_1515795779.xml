Since several of these models are introduced by Petri and his group within General Net Theory [4] they can also be called u0027high-level Petri netsu0027. We discuss the motivation and usefulness of such extensions, as well as some of their disadvantages. While many of these models are only informally presented, we give a more formal definition of self-modifying nets together with a new presentation. On the other hand we do not consider such models that are combinations of Petri nets with other models, such as the program schemata of Roucairol f213 or evaluation nets of Noe [19~ .</abstract></paper>

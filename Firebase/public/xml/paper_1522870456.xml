Both essential and desirable features of an expert system application are discussed. Essential features are used to ensure that the application does not require technology beyond the state of the art. Desirable features help point to the applications that stand the greatest chance for successful implementation. Advice on helpful directions for evaluating candidate expert system applications is also given.</abstract></paper>

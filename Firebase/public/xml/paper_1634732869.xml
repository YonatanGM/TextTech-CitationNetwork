A major limitation of current WfMSs is their lack of support for dynamic workflow adaptations. This functionality is an important requirement in order to provide sufficient flexibility to cope with expected but unusual situations and failures. In this paper, we propose Self-Adaptive Recovery Net (SARN), an extended Petri net model for specifying exceptional behavior in workflow systems at design time. SARN can adapt the structure of the underlying Petri net at run time to handle exceptions while keeping the Petri net design simple and easy. The proposed framework also caters for high-level recovery policies that are incorporated either with a single task or a set of tasks, called a recovery region.</abstract></paper>

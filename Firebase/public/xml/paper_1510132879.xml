The method of determining whether the recovered message is the correct one has not been throughly investigated. In this paper, we suggest a systematic method of checking, and describe a generalized version of the cryptanalytic attack which reduces the work factor sigdicantly (factor of 211 for the commonly used example of n=1024 Goppa code case). Some more improvements are also given. We also note that these cryptanalytic algorithms can be viewed as generalized probabilistic decoding algorithms for any linear error correcting codes.</abstract></paper>

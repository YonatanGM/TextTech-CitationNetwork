The flow should have safety properties such as deadlock freedom and application specific progress properties. At the same time, the flow should satisfy some security properties since it is executed in an open network environment. This paper introduces an idea of a lattice-based security label into BPEL, a Web flow description language being standardized, in order to detect potential insecure information leakage. It further discusses that both the safety and security aspects can be analyzed in a single framework using the model-checking verification techniques.</abstract></paper>

It is shown that while the number of sequential jobs dominates the number of parallel jobs, most of the resources (measured in node-seconds) were consumed by parallel jobs. Moreover, most of the sequential jobs were for system administration. The average runtime of jobs grew with the number of nodes used, so the total resource requirements of large parallel jobs were larger by more than the number of nodes they used. The job submission rate during peak day activity was somewhat lower than one every two minutes, and the average job size was small. At night, submission rate was low but job sizes and system utilization were high, mainly due to NQS. Submission rate and utilization over the weekend were lower than on weekdays. The overall utilization was 50%, after accounting for downtime. About 2/3 of the applications were executed repeatedly, some for a significant number of times.</abstract></paper>

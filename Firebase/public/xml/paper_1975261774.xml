Furthermore, the finiteness is decidable. Thus, the containment and equality problem for finite reachability sets become solvable. We investigate the complexity of decision procedures for these two problems and show by reducing a bounded version of Hilbertu0027u0027s Tenth problem to the finite containment problem that these two problems are extremely hard, that, in fact, the complexity of each decision procedure exceeds any primitive recursive function infinitely often. The finite containment and quality problem are thus the first uncontrived, decidable problems with provably non-primitive recursive complexity.</abstract></paper>

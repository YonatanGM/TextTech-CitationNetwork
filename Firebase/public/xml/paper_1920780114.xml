One reason for this are recent developments in active database research which have resulted in first commercially available database management systems with active components. To support this rule-based active mechanisms, it is desirable that rules can be taken into account on the conceptual level. Another important reason for focusing on rules is their importance within organizations; in this context the term business rules is used. This paper defines and structures business rules as a main component of systems analysis, presents results of a case study, and introduces a meta-model and a repository system for business rules.</abstract></paper>

Processes of contextual nets are represented as partial orders with some extra structure. Operations of composing processes are defined such that each process of a contextual net can be obtained by combining processes corresponding to places and transitions of this net. Matrix-like characteristics of processes, called tables, and natural operations on such characteristics are defined such that the correspondence between processes and their characteristics is a homomorphism.</abstract></paper>

However collisions for Snefru were found in 1990, and recently a collision of MD4 was also found. This casts doubt on how long these functionsu0027 variants, such as RIPE-MD, MD5, SHA, SHA1 and Snefru-8, will remain unbroken. Furthermore, all these functions were designed for 32-bit processors, and cannot be implemented efficiently on the new generation of 64-bit processors such as the DEC Alpha. We therefore present a new hash function which we believe to be secure; it is designed to run quickly on 64-bit processors, without being too slow on existing machines.</abstract></paper>

This analysis extends the work from De Jongu0027s thesis, which dealt with disruption of n-point crossover on 2nd order hyperplanes. We present various extensions to this theory, including 1) an analysis of the disruption of n-point crossover on kth order hyperplanes; 2) the computation of tighter bounds on the disruption caused by n-point crossover, by handling cases where parents share critical allele values; and 3) an analysis of the disruption caused by uniform crossover on kth order hyperplanes. The implications of these results on implementation issues and performance are discussed, and several directions for further research are suggested.</abstract></paper>

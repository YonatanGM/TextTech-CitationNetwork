Several unique systems to support meetings electronically have been developed in industry and universities. The PLEXSYS systems at the University of Arizona have been operational since 1985 and are now being implemented in industrial sites. This article proposes and defines a new term for information technology systems that support group meetings: electronic meeting systems (EMS). EMSs are more than group decision support systems (GDSS): they support more tasks than just decision making; they focus on communication. They move beyond the GDSS decision room where groups must meet at the same time in the same place, to meetings that can be conducted across time ands pace. The article then presents a model fo th EMS concept, which has three components: group process and outcomes; methods; and environment. Each of these component is explained in turn, and the implications derived form their study to date are discussed. Finally, the implementation of information technology for meeting support and its use in corporate settings will be addressed, as it has implications for productivity, meeting size, group member participat9ion, and the role of the IS department.</abstract></paper>

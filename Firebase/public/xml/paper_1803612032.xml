Furthermore we show that the criteria for the construction of DES-like S-boxes proposed by Kim [6] are insufficient to assure resistance against differential attacks. We show several good iterative characteristics for these S-boxes to be used in differential attacks. Finally we examine the probabilities of the two characteristics used by Biham and Shamir in [3], We found that for some keys we do not get the probabilities used in the attack. We suggest the use of 5 characteristics instead of two in the attack on DES.</abstract></paper>

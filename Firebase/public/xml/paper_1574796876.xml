The complete material is illustrated by several examples, especially by applications to a "very small data base system", where consistent states are represented as graphs, operation rules and operations as productions and derivations in a graph grammar respectively. Further applications to recursively defined functions, record handling, compiler techniques and development and evolution in Biology are sketched in the introduction. This survey is divided into the following :[95],"CONSTRUCTIONS FOR :[98],"GRAPH :[100],"PROPERTIES, PARALLELISM â€” AND CONCURRENCY :[106],"OF DERIVATION :[98],"GRAPH :[111],"STAR GLUING :[115],"CONCEPTS :[106],"OF CATEGORY THEORY USED IN THE ALGEBRAIC THEORY :[106],"OF :[98],"GRAPH</abstract></paper>

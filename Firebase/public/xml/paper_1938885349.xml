With rising industry demand and career opportunities, more and more universities are offering graduates ubiquitous computing courses in addition to classical computer science curricula, such as mobile computing and wireless sensor networks. Here, I outline a graduate-level ubiquitous computing course I taught for final-year masteru0027s and first-year doctoral students in Finland at Abo Akademi University in 2006. Finland - the home of Nokia, the worldu0027s largest mobile phone maker - has more mobile devices per person than any other country, and its students are very interested in ubiquitous computing technologies. The experiences gained and lessons learned are a good source of information and reference for other educators in this field.</abstract></paper>

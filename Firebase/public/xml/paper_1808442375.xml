In recent years different approaches have been proposed to avoid explicit calibration. In this paper a new method is proposed which is closely related to some of the existing methods. Some interesting relations between the methods are uncovered. The method proposed in this paper shows some clear advantages. Besides some synthetic experiments a metric model is extracted from a video sequence to illustrate the feasibility of the approach.</abstract></paper>

Many systems are under development to aid in the detection of these abuses. The capabilities of these u0027intrusion detection systemsu0027 (IDS) are varied, ranging from tools that provide for the meaningful reduction of audit data to tools that provide in-depth analysis of user and system behavior. The authors have performed a survey of the state-of-the-art in intrusion detection systems. This paper presents a summary of this survey. u003e</abstract></paper>

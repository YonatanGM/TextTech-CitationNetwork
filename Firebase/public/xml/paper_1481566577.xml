A general method is presented that allows predictions to use both instance-based and model-based learning. Results with three approaches to constructing models and with eight datasets demonstrate improvements due to the composite learning with continuous :[50],"classes, instance-based learning, model-based learning, empirical evaluation.</abstract></paper>

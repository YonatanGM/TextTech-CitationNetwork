In this paper we consider another multiple key cipher also based on a well known cryptographic function, exponentiation in a prime field. The important difference from multiple key RSA is that this function does not possess the trapdoor property. At the end of [1] we speculated that such functions may have useful applications and here we give as one illustration a new voting scheme.</abstract></paper>

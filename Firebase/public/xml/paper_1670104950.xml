Key to a reliable and efficient implementation of a message passing library on these machines is the careful design of a UNIX-Socket like layer in the user space with controlled access to the communication adapters and with adequate recovery and flow control. The performance of this implementation is at the same level as the IBM-proprietary message passing library (MPL). We also show that in the IBM SP1 and SP2 we achieve integrated tracing ability, where both system events, such as context switches and page fault etc., and MPI related activities are traced, with minimal overhead to the application program, thus presenting application programmers the trace of all the events that ultimately affect efficiency of a parallel program.</abstract></paper>

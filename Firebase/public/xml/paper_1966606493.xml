The detection of :[9],"such covert communication is referred to as steganalysis. To date, steganalysis research has focused primarily on either, the extraction of features from a document that are sensitive to the embedding, or the inference of some statistical difference between marked and unmarked objects. In this work, we evaluate the statistical limits of :[9],"such techniques by developing asymptotically optimal tests (Maximum Likelihood) for a number of side informed embedding schemes. The required probability density functions (pdf) are derived for Dither Modulation (DM) and Distortion-Compensated Dither Modulation (DC-DM/SCS) from an steganalystu0027s point of view. For both embedding techniques, the pdfs are derived in the presence and absence of a secret dither key. The resulting tests are then compared to a robust blind steganalytic test based on feature extraction. The performance of the tests is evaluated using an integral measure and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.</abstract></paper>

This algorithm relies essentially on using the narrowing process defined by Lankford [13]. In this paper, we first study the relations between narrowing and unification and we give a new version of Fayu0027s algorithm. We then show how to eliminate many redundancies in this algorithm and give a sufficient condition for the termination of the algorithm. In a last part, we show how to extend the previous results to various kinds of canonical term rewriting systems.</abstract></paper>

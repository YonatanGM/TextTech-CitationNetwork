This paper proposes to take software testability predictions into account throughout the development process. These predictions can be made from formal specifications, design documents, and the code itself. The insight provided by software testability is valuable during design, coding, testing and quality assurance. The authors believe that software testability analysis can play a crucial role in quantifying the likelihood that faults are not hiding, after the testing does not result in any failures for the current version. u003e</abstract></paper>

This factoring operation is done implicitly when one refers to u0027u0027tree structuresu0027u0027 or u0027u0027arraysu0027u0027 as generic objects. Structural uniformities in data graphs can often be exploited to facilitate and systematize the accessing of nodes in the graph and the implementation of the graph in a computer. This paper presents a model for data graphs which can be used to study such uniformities. The main results reported algebraically characterize, in terms of structural uniformities, those classes of data graphs which can be implemented by u0027u0027relative addressingu0027u0027 and by u0027u0027relocatable realizationsu0027u0027.</abstract></paper>

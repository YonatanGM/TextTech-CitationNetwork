We experiment with the model-checking of an application-layer html-based web-camera which involves structures like event queues, high-layer communication channels, and time-outs. To contain the complexity, we implement our verification tool with a newly developed BDD-like data-structure, reduced CRD (Clock-Restriction Diagram), which has enhanced the verification performance through intensive data-sharing in a previous report. However, the representation of reduced CRD does not allow for quick test of zone containment. To this purpose, we thus have designed a new CRD-based representation, cascade CRD, which has given us enough performance enhancement to successfully verifying several implementations of the web-camera.</abstract></paper>

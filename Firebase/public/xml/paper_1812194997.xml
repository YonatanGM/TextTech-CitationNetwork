The main questions addressed are: How big is the share of companies that use data models? Who is responsible for data modelling? What are the main application areas for data modelling? How should data modelling projects be organised in order to make a profit? What is the size of project, departmental and enterprise data models actually in use? How can we tell a „good“ from a „bad“ data model? Based on the results of the empirical study a new quality concept for data modelling is motivated which focusses on the design of the organisational context of data modelling. This is seen as the single most important success factor regarding data modelling efforts.</abstract></paper>

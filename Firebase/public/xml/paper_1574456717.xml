Especially when considering the rule generation as being part of an interactive KDD-process this becomes annoying. In this paper we discuss strengths and weaknesses of known approaches to generate frequent itemsets. Based on the insights we derive a new algorithm, called Prutax, to mine generalized frequent itemsets. The basic ideas of the algorithm and further optimisation are described. Experiments with both synthetic and real-life data show that Prutax is an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches.</abstract></paper>

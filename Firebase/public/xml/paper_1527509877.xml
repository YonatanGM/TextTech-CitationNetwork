By working with conjugate sets of Puiseux expansions, we prove this method is rational in the sense that the answers it produces are defined over K. Given a curve with only ordinary multiple points and allowing precomputation of singular places, the running time of addition using this algorithm is dominated by M7 coefficient operations in a field extension of bounded degree, where M is the larger of the degree and the genus of the curve.</abstract></paper>

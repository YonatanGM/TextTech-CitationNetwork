However, the procedure will fail if it generates equations which cannot be oriented into rules (i.e., the system is not noetherian), or if it generates infinitely many rules (i.e., the system is not confluent). In 1981 Huet showed that even if the system is not confluent, the Knuth-Bendix procedure still yields a semi-decision procedure for word problems, provided that every equation can be oriented. In this paper we show that even if some equations are not orientable, the Knuth-Bendix procedure can still be modified into a reasonably efficient semi-decision procedure for word problems in equational theories. Thus, we have lifted the noetherian requirement in the Knuth-Bendix procedure. Several confluence results, extensions, and experiments are given. So are some comparisons with related work.</abstract></paper>

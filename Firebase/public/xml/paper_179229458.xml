This essay addresses three questions implicit in this discussion: Is there an agreed upon epistemology underlying IS research? To whom should IS be relevant or alternatively what ends should this research serve? Does the choice of research method contribute to the creation of relevant IS research? These questions are explored from the perspective on an unrepentant idealist.</abstract></paper>

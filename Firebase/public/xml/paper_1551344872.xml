As complexity of the spatial objects increases, the effectiveness of this strategy decreases, due to the inaccuracy of the approximation. Some access methods store objects redundantly to compensate. Each copy represents some portion of the object. The method by which redundancy is obtained is crucial in determining the degree of success that can be achieved. Two strategies for obtaining redundancy are compared, one based on recursive partitioning of the space containing the data objects, and the other based on type-specific object partitionings. Experimental results using a data set containing line segments suggest that the former approach is more effective in improving performance.</abstract></paper>

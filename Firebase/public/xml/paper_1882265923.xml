The focus of the paper is on point (c). The underlying event theory of the semantics of verb phrase modification, which theory has recently appeared in the literature, is especially promising as part of the basis for a formal language for electronic commerce. Not only does this theory supply new and useful representation techniques, but it fits well with prior work on the representation of speech acts.</abstract></paper>

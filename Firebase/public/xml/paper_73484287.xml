This article focuses on two probability language, the Bayesian language and the language of belief functions [199]. We describe and compare the semantics (i.e., the meaning of the scale) and the syntax (i.e., the formal calculus) of these languages. We also investigate some of the designs for probability judgment afforded by the two languages.</abstract></paper>

An independently researched process is described in detail with an emphasis on implementation issues regarding digital images. A scheme using stego keys to create pseudo-random sample sequences is developed. Issues relating to using digital signals for steganography are explored. The terms modified remainder and unmodified remainder are defined. Possible attacks are considered in detail from passive wardens and methods of defeating such attacks are suggested. Software implementing the new ideas is introduced, which has been successfully developed, deployed and used for several years without detection.</abstract></paper>

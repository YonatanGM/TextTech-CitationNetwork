This paper proposes an approach to ensure that such adaptations are safe with respect to system consistency. The proposed method takes into consideration dependency analysis for target components, specifically determining viable sequences of adaptive actions and those states in which an adaptive action may be applied safely. We demonstrate that the technique ensures safe adaptation (insertion, removal, and replacement of components) in response to changing external conditions in a wireless multicast video application.</abstract></paper>

The most useful components in a design are frameworks - schemes of interaction between objects. These can be worked on by separate authors, kept in libraries, and recombined to make many different end-products. This paper explores the more formal aspects of this approach, within the context of popular OOA/D notations and programming languages.</abstract></paper>

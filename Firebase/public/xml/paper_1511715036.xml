This approach is based on mapping lines in R3 into points and hyperplanes in 5-dimensional projective space (Plucker space). We improve previously known results on the following :[39],"n triangles so as to efficiently answer the query: “Given a ray, which is the first triangle hit?” (Ray-shooting problem). We discuss the ray-shooting problem for both disjoint and non-disjoint triangles and several space/time trade :[75],"detect the first face hit by any ray in a set of axis-oriented :[39],"n lines :[89],"(segments) so as to efficiently answer the query “Given 2 lines, is it possible to move one into the other without crossing any of the initial lines (segments)?” (Isotopy problem). If the movement is possible produce an explicit representation of the :[132],"arrangement generated by :[39],"n intersecting triangles in 3-space in an output-sensitive way, with a subquadratic overhead the :[150],"number of pairs of intersecting lines in a set of :[39],"n lines in space.</abstract></paper>

Information technology can be a significant factor in leveraging investments in maintenance and in directing a firmu0027s overall approach to the maintenance issue. This paper presents a conceptual framework for understanding, along with a series of examples that illustrate, the role information technology can play in the maintenance process. The framework and examples are intended to serve as a catalyst for identifying applications of information technology to post-sale maintenance.</abstract></paper>

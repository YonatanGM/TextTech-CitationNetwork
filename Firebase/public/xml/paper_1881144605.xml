The work is a collaboration between medical professionals from a major regional cancer center and computer science researchers. The work uses the Little-JIL language to create precise process definitions, the Propel system to specify precise process requirements, and the FLAVERS system to verify that the process definitions adhere to the requirement specifications. The paper describes how these technologies were applied to successfully identify defects in the chemotherapy process. Although this work is still ongoing, early experiences suggest that this approach can help reduce medical errors and improve patient safety. The work has also helped us to learn about the desiderata for process definition and analysis technologies, both of which are expected to be broadly applicable to other domains.</abstract></paper>

When “preservation of qualitative behavior” is interpreted in a strict sense, as having all original sequences of events with their original ordering we obtain the following two :[73],"acyclic (combinatorial) circuits whose inputs change only once, the answer is positive: there is a constant δ, depending on the maximal number of possible events in the circuit, such that if we restrict all events to take place at multiples of δ, we still preserve qualitative :[120],"cyclic circuits the answer is negative: a simple circuit with three gates can demonstrate a qualitative behavior which cannot be captured by any discretization.</abstract></paper>

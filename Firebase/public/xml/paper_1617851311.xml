Protocols are given both for N prime and for N :[51],"also give protocols for extensions of the Discrete Log problem allowing A to show possession of: - multiple discrete logarithms to the same base at the same time, i.e. knowing x1,....,xK such that αx1 ≡ β1,..., αxK βK - several discrete logarithms to different bases at the same time, i.e. knowing x1,..., xK such that the product α1x1 α2x2... αKxk ≡ β - a discrete logarithm that is the simultaneous solution of several different instances, i.e. knowing x such that α1x ≡ β1,..., αKx ≡ :[137],"can prove that the sequential versions of these protocols do not reveal any "knowledge" about the discrete logarithm(s) in a well-defined sense, provided that A knows (a multiple of) the order of α.</abstract></paper>

The practical objective of this search is, of course, to produce ever more powerful automated reasoning programs. In this paper, we show how the power of such programs can be sharply increased by employing inference rules called linked inference rules. In particular, we focus on linked UR-resolutlon, a generalization of standard UR-resolution [2], and discuss ongoing experiments that permit comparison of the two inference rules. The intention is to present the results of those experiments at the Seventh Conference on Automated Deduction. Much of the treatment of linked inference rules given in this paper is from the userâ€™s viewpoint, with certain abstract considerations reserved for Section 3.</abstract></paper>

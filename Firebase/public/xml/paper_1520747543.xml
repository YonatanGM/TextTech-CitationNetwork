Itu0027s design was driven by the special nature of communications systems. The most fundamental aspect of communications systems is that many fairly simple things are happening at the same time, for all time. It is precisely this aspect that is so difficult to specify in languages based on a sequential or asynchronous model. It is easy to specify this in L.0 because L.0 has an abstract concurrent-readcommon-concurrent-write shared memory model, a notion of next, and because the basic composition operator is conjunction. Another fundamental aspect of communications systems is that many of the things happening simultaneously are very similar. Thus, another basic feature of L.0 is quantification, which permits parametrized specifications.</abstract></paper>

In most applications of language theory for Petri nets one considers completely sequentialized versions of Petri nets only. That is one assumes that a Petri net has one central run place which allows only a single transition to fire at a time; any sequence of such firings is called a firing sequence and the language of a Petri net consists of the set of all firing sequences (or only of those firing sequences that lead to one of the finite number of final markings).</abstract></paper>

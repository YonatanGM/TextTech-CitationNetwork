These two concepts are then introduced through a modification of the marking of a Petri net with Objects, and of its interpretation (external conditions associated with the transitions). It is shown how, in some cases, uncertainty is propagated and how, sometimes, it is possible to go back to certainty. Finally, an illustrative example is described.</abstract></paper>

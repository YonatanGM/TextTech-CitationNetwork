Two bodies of theory offer useful and needed perspectives on both the risks and the factors or variables which affect the risk of outsourcing IT. Transaction cost economics provides a thorough description of the conditions under which the risks of opportunism and inflated transaction costs are high. The resource-based view of competitive strategy proposes variables that affect outsourcing hazards even when opportunism can be ruled out. The resource-based view is consequently particularly helpful in the examination of outsourcing contracts described as partnerships.</abstract></paper>

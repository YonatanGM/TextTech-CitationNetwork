It produces a domain of specifications, which is a retract of the lattice of sets of tests (with the subset ordering), and a domain of nondeterministic machines (ndms), which is a retract of the lattice of sets of machines (with the superset ordering). These two domains are isomorphic. Simple conditions ensure that they are Ï‰-algebraic.</abstract></paper>

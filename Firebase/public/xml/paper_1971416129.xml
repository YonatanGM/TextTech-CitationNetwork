Such graphs are generalizations of Cayley graphs of context-free groups. They are also shown to be definable in a very natural way in terms of push-down automata. Using Rabinu0027s theorem on the monadic second-order theory of the finite binary tree, these graphs are also shown to have a decidable monadic second-order theory. Questions about tiling systems and cellular automata operating on these graphs are decidable even when the analogous questions are not, when the systems operate on a two-dimensional grid.</abstract></paper>

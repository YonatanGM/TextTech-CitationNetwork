Its selection should be based on a systematic analysis of technical requirements and constraints, as well as of the types of variabilities, which occur in a particular application domain and are relevant for the planned product line (PL). In addition, each technique should provide a set of guidelines and criteria that support developers in applying the techniques in a systematic and unified way. This paper presents a case study that was performed to evaluate aspect-oriented programming (AOP) as a PL implementation technology. The systematical evaluation is organized along a general evaluation schema for PL implementation technologies.</abstract></paper>

We present a stronger nation of verifiable secret sharing and exhibit a protocol implementing it. We show that our new notion is preferable to the old ones whenever verifiable secret sharing is used as a tool within larger protocols, rather than being a goal in itself. Indeed our definition, and so our protocol satisfying it, provably guarantees reducibilty. Applications of this new notion in the field of secure multiparty computation are also provided.</abstract></paper>

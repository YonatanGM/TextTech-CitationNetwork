The current study compares two different ems software tools in a controlled experiment. Dependent variables are decision quality, number of unique alternatives generated, satisfaction, and consensus. The study found that one software tool produced better quality solutions to a combination creativity and intellective task, but the other helped generate more unique alternatives. Each tool worked best on the task for which it was designed. The findings support the authorsâ€™ premise that there should be a match between the ems software tool and the task to be performed. The findings have several implications for the design of ems software.</abstract></paper>

Some expected and some unexpected results were obtained for decision performance (quality, speed, choice, shift) and group member perceptions (confidence and satisfaction). Use of a GDSS, for example, increased the time it took groups to reach a decision yet had no impact on the decision quality of the groups. Also, there was a substantial interaction effect regarding choice shift. The ramifications of these results are discussed fully.</abstract></paper>

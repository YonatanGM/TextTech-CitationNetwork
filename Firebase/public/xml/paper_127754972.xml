From the formulation of the average marking in steady-state, we first establish a set of necessary conditions between the initial marking, the firing times and frequencies of transitions, the dates of first firing occurences and the minimal delays of tokens at places. These conditions are shown to provide a lower bound to the cycle time, using the minimal S-invariants of the net. A modeling of multi-stage production systems is further developed, based on timed Petri Nets, and the results obtained are used to conduct a performance evaluation of the system.</abstract></paper>

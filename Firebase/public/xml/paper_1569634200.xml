In this contribution a passive 3-D scanning system is described that automatically computes a complete 3-D surface model of a human head and shoulder part from a stereoscopic image sequence of a person rotating freely in front of the camera. No active element like a laser scanner is required for the modeling. 3-D shape, surface texture and the 3-D motion of the head is extracted solely from the image sequence. A dense map of 3-D surface points is obtained by image correspondence, object segmentation, interpolation, and triangulation. The surface geometry of the object is approximated by a triangular wire-frame which stores the surface texture in texture maps. Sequence processing serves to track head motion and to fuse surfaces from different view points into a consistent 3-D surface model. From the textured 3-D model highly realistic image sequences from arbitrary view points can be synthesized using computer graphics techniques.</abstract></paper>

To do so, we divide the visualization task based on three aspects of CSP: (i) the dynamics behavior, (ii) the static architecture, and (iii) the refinement assertions. In doing so we are able to visualize CSP via UML in a hierarchical manner which enhances understanding in the design process. In a way, we also provide a formal verification for the UML diagrams using CSP, since there are model checkers like FDR available. We have adopted the use of UML state diagram and class diagram for our work. In addition, we have outlined a prototyped tool that translates these diagrams to CSP that could be model-checked in FDR.</abstract></paper>

First, the most used definitions are reviewed, in particular, Dempster conditioning, and upper-lower probabilities conditioning. It is shown that the former has a tendency to be too informative, and the last, by the contrary, too uninformative. Another definitions are also considered, as weak and strong conditioning. After, a new concept of conditional information is introduced. It is based on lower-upper probabilities definition, but introduces an estimation of the true probability distribution, by a method analogous to statistical maximum likelihood.</abstract></paper>

This paper extends the use of algebraic attacks to combiners with memory. A (k,l)-combiner consists of k parallel linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs), and the nonlinear filtering is done via a finite automaton with k input bits and l memory bits. It is shown that for (k,l)-combiners, nontrivial canceling relations of degree at most ⌈k(l+1)/2⌉ exist. This makes algebraic attacks possible. Also, a general method is presented to check for such relations with an even lower degree. This allows to show the invulnerability of certain (k,l)-combiners against this kind of algebraic attacks. On the other hand, this can also be used as a tool to find improved algebraic attacks.</abstract></paper>

The security is controversial, since we have no proof of security, but the best known attacks require more than 280 computations. We called FLASH our algorithm and we also proposed SFLASH, a version that has a smaller public key and faster verification though one should be even more careful about itu0027s security.FLASH and SFLASH have been accepted as submissions to NESSIE (New European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity, and Encryption), a project within the Information Societies Technology (IST) Programme of the European Commission.</abstract></paper>

In this paper we present a process construction kit for the capture and dissemination of process knowledge at the level of process structures as well as process construction experience. Our approach ranges from the formal capture and maintenance of know-how about processes to the implementation of process adaptations in terms of object-oriented concepts. Requirements are drawn from specific reference applications in the automotive engineering and the plant construction domain.</abstract></paper>

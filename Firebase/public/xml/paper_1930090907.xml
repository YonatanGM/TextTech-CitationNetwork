The originality of this approach was to be able to remove the gap between the information required to apply a general theory of diagnosis and the limited information actually available. The expertu0027s ability to detect a defect by reasoning about the significant changes in behavior it induces is extensively exploited here: as a kind of reasoning that justifies the qualitative modeling, as a heuristic that defmes a strategy and as a working hypothesis that makes clear the scope of this approach.</abstract></paper>

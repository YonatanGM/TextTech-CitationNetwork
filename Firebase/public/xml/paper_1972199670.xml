Strategic planning has moved IS from serving primarily as a support function to a point where it may influence corporate strategy. The strength of this influence, however, usually is determined by the nature of the relationship between the chief information officer (CIO) and the CEO. Generally the more satisfied CEOs are with CIOs, the greater the influence IS has on top-level decisions. Results of a nationwide survey of motor carrier CEOs and CIOs indicate that CEOs are generally satisfied with their CIOsu0027 activities, and that CIOs perceive CEOs as placing a high priority on strategic IS plans. However, IS does not appear to be truly a part of corporate strategy formulation.</abstract></paper>

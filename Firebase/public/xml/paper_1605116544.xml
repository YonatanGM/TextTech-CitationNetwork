In the proposed cipher, the plaintext and the ciphertext are 64 bit blocks, while the secret key is 128 bit long. The cipher is based on the design concept of "mixing operations from different algebraic groups". The cipher structure was chosen to provide confusion and diffusion and to facilitate both hardware and software implementations.</abstract></paper>

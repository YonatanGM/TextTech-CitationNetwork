Recently, constraint-based approaches, which use arithmetic constraints as a symbolic representation, have been used in symbolic model checking of infinite-state systems. We argue that use of constraint-based model checking is not limited to infinite-state systems. It can also be used as an alternative to BDD-based model checking for systems with integer variables which have finite but large domains. In this paper we investigate the trade-offs between these two approaches experimentally. We compare the performance of BDD-based model checker SMV to the performance of our constraint-based model checker on verification of several asynchronous concurrent systems. The results indicate that constraint-based model checking is a viable option for verification of asynchronous concurrent systems with large integer domains.</abstract></paper>

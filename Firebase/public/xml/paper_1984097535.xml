At present, the ZIP Machine is emulated by software, but it has been designed to permit easy implementation in microcode or hardware. Prolog-X running on the software-based emulator provides performance comparable with existing Prolog interpreters. To demonstrate its efficiency, compatibility, and comprehensiveness of implementation, Prolog-X has been used to compile and run several large applications programs. Several novel techniques are used in the implementation, particularly in the areas of the representation of therecordx database, the selection of clauses, and the compilation of arithmetic expressions.</abstract></paper>

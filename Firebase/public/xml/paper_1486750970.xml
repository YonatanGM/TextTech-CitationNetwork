Explicit calibration is not always practical and has to be repeated regularly. Sometimes it is even impossible (i.e. for pictures taken by an unknown camera of an unknown scene). The second possibility is to do auto-calibration. Here the rigidity of the scene is used to obtain constraints on the camera parameters. Existing approaches of this second strand impose that the camera parameters stay exactly the same between different views. This can be very limiting since it excludes changing the focal length to zoom or focus. The paper describes a reconstruction method that allows to vary the focal length. Instead of using one camera one can also use a stereo rig following similar principles, and in which case also reconstruction from a moving rig becomes possible even for pure translation. Synthetic data were used to see how resistant the algorithm is to noise. The results are satisfactory. Also results for a real scene were convincing.</abstract></paper>

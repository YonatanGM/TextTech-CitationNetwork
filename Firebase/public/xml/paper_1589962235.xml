This problem is a well-studied problem in several areas like theory of coteries, database theory, hypergraph theory or computational learning theory. In this paper we exhibit polynomial time algorithms for testing self-duality for several natural classes of formulas where the problem was not known to be solvable. Some of the results are obtained by means of a new characterization of self-dual formulas in terms of its Fourier spectrum.</abstract></paper>

BPspecifications frequently need to accommodate changing business priorities,varying client preferences, etc. However, since business process goals and preferencesare Rarely captured explicitly in the dominant BP modeling approaches,adapting business processes proves difficult. We propose a systematic requirements-driven approach for BP design and configuration management that usesrequirements goal models to capture alternative process configurations and providesthe ability to tailor deployed processes to changing business priorities orcustomer preferences (i.e., non-functional constraints) by configuring their correspondinggoal models at the goal level. A set of design time and runtime toolsfor configuring business processes implemented using WS-BPEL is provided,allowing to easily change the behaviour of deployed BP instances at a highlevel, based on business priorities and stakeholder preferences.</abstract></paper>

Progress, however, is now being made in computer-aided techniques to be used in the development of information systems. Most of the limited number of automated aids available require large computer systems for their operations. This paper describes a computer-aided systems analysis and documentation system which has been implemented on a PDP-11/40 computer running under the UNIX operating system. In particular, the database design and implementation considerations with in a small minicomputer environment of the SPSL/SPSA system are presented. Also the experiences gained in the use of this system are reported. Finally, several extensions to the existing SPSL/SPSA system currently under development are described.</abstract></paper>

This paper extends the previous technique to include piecewise nonlinear functions as mapping functions. A nonlinear mapping function in addition to providing continuous mapping, provides smooth transition from one local function to another. The obtained mapping function which is a piecewise combination of local mapping functions is therefore continuous and smooth all over. A technique based on the Clough-Tocher subtriangulation(2) is described which determines piecewise cubic mapping functions for image registration.</abstract></paper>

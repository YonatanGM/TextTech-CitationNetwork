In order to decide which people will receive the mailing, the potential customers are divided into two groups or classes (buyers and non-buyers) and a response model is created. Since the improvement of response modeling is the purpose of this paper, we suggest a combined approach of rule-induction and case-based reasoning. The initial classification of buyers and non-buyers is done by means of the C5-algorithm. To improve the ranking of the classified cases, we introduce in this research rule-predicted typicality. The combination of these two approaches is tested on synergy by elaborating a direct mail example.</abstract></paper>

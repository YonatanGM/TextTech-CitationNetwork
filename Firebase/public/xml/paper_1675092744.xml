We demonstrate our technique in the context of face detection with complex background without color or motion information, which has proven to be a challenging problem. We use a family of discrete Markov processes to model the face and background patterns and estimate the probability models using the data statistics. Then, we convert the learning process into an optimization, selecting the Markov process that optimizes the information-based discrimination between the two classes. The detection process is carried out by computing the likelihood ratio using the probability model obtained from the learning procedure. We show that because of the discrete nature of these models, the detection process is at least two orders of magnitude less computationally expensive than neural network approaches. However, no improvement in terms of correct-answer/false-alarm tradeoff is achieved.</abstract></paper>

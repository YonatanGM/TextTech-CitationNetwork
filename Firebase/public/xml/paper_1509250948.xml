The aim of QoS–aware service composition is to determine the set of services that, once composed, will perform the required functionality, and will best contribute to achieve the level of QoS promised in Service Level Agreements (SLAs). While the existing works focus on cross–domain QoS attributes, it would be useful to support service composition and binding according to some characteristics on the borderline between functional and non–functional attributes, often specific to the service :[89],"paper describes a QoS evaluator that, integrated with our previously developed binder, allows the use of application specific QoS attributes for composite service binding and re–binding. The applicability of the proposed approach and tool is shown through a case study related to the image processing domain.</abstract></paper>

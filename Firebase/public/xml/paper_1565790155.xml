Without additional setup assumptions, no witness hiding protocol can securely ensure that the prover knows a witness in this scenario. This is because the prover may just be forwarding messages between the environment and the verifier while the environment performs all the necessary this :[66],"paper we consider an l-isolated prover, which is restricted to exchanging at most l bits of information with its environment. We introduce a new notion called l-isolated proofs of knowledge (l-IPoK). These protocols securely ensure that an l-isolated prover knows the witness. To prevent the above-mentioned attack, an l-IPoK protocol has to have communication complexity greater than l. We show that for any relation in NP and any value l, there is an l-IPoK protocol for that relation. In addition, the communication complexity of such a protocol only needs to be larger than l by a constant multiplicative factor.</abstract></paper>

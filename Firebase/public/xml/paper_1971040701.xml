Being able to touch, feel, and manipulate objects in virtual environments has a large number of exciting applications. The underlying technology, both in terms of electromechanical hardware and computer software, is becoming mature and has opened up novel and interesting research areas. In this paper, we clarify the terminology of human and machine haptics and provide a brief overview of the progress recently achieved in these fields, based on our investigations as well as other studies. We describe the major advances in a new discipline, Computer Haptics (analogous to computer graphics), that is concerned with the techniques and processes associated with generating and displaying haptic stimuli to the human user. We also summarize the issues and some of our results in integrating haptics into multimodal and distributed virtual environments, and speculate on the challenges for the future.</abstract></paper>

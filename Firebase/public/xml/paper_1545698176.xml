It is therefore essential that such devices be extensively tested for malfunction. The purpose of a statistical test is to detect specific weaknesses in random :[36],"universal test is a very common randomness test, capable of detecting a wide range of statistical defects. The test is based on the computation of a function which is asymptotically related to the sourceu0027s entropy, which measures the effective key-size of block ciphers keyed by the sourceu0027s :[84],"this work we develop a variant of Maureru0027s test where the test function is in theory exactly equal to the sourceu0027s entropy, thereby enabling a better detection of defects in the tested source.</abstract></paper>

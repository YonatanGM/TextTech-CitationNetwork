The EPOS process modeling (PM) support system runs on top of the versioned EPOSDB, operating in client-server mode. EPOSDB offers cooperating subdatabases/workspaces for each subproject. The originality of the EPOS approach to PM flexibility lies in a common, reflexive, object-oriented data model to describe persistent and versioned products, activities, tools, organizational contexts, and their meta-processes. A process model or schema is a set of data types for such entities and their relationships. A PM Manager is capable of defining and changing process models. A Planner will instantiate them into software processes. Work is going on to use roles and access rights to better control process change, and to support the full process model life-cycle by a “CASE tool” for PM.</abstract></paper>

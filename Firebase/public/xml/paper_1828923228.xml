Unfortunately, most of todayu0027s workflow products allow for erroneous processes to be put in production: these products lack proper verificationmechanisms in their process-definition tools for the created or modified processes. This paper presents the workflow diagnosis tool Woflan, which fills this gap. Using Petri-net based techniques, Woflan diagnoses process definitions before they are put into production. These process definitions can be imported from commercial workflow products. Furthermore, Woflan guides the modeler of a workflow process definition towards finding and correcting possible errors.</abstract></paper>

The large scale complexity and diversity of todayâ€™s information systems are discussed within the context of a software engineering (SE) model and the higher-level view of the product that SE provides. The history and scope of investments in computing, and the practices of software engineering demonstrate that we are not a New Collective 2 suffering from an identity crisis. We are a heterogeneous group looking at a wide diversity of Information Systems, some of which challenge the way we think about organizational boundaries and show that artifacts are not adequate to define IT.</abstract></paper>

But some software designers still find it a little difficult to work directly with Petri nets, specially when dealing with large systems, and they prefer to work with a formalism closer to a programming language, such as algebraic specification languages. Our goal, then, in this paper is to present an automatic translation of specifications written in a (timed) algebraic language (TPAL) into a timed model of Petri nets (Timed-Arc Petri nets). In this task we try to exploit as far as possible the special characteristics of Timed-Arc Petri nets, more specifically the presence of dead tokens, which allows us to extend in some particular cases the classical translations.</abstract></paper>

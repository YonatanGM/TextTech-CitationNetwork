Different versions may arise at any time during the development process, due to different individuals or teams working on different parts of the overall model. To manage these versions it is necessary to be able to identify differences and reconcile these differences in a single, integrated model. We describe the use of model merging technology for managing different versions of a model in an industrial software development process. The use of automated model merging technology is contrasted with an alternative, semi-automated approach. The contributions of model merging to helping to solve this problem are outlined.</abstract></paper>

We show that, an even more liberalized version, the \(\delta ^{ + ^ + }\)-rule, that in addition reduces the number of different Skolem-function symbols that have to be used, is also sound and complete. Examples show the relevance of this modification for building tableau-based theorem provers.</abstract></paper>

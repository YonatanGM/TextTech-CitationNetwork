By normal cryptogaphy, I mean not protocols to accomplish sophisticated goals, but merely the situation where party A wishes to send a message to party B over a line which is being tapped. Existing definitions of such a system, when they aren’t too vague, are overly restrictive; existing definitions of security of such systems, when given rigorously, are usually overly liberal. In this paper I’ll present what seem to me to be the proper definitions, give statements of the basic theorems I know about these definitions, and raise some very fundamental open questions. Most of the definitions and results appeared in [R].</abstract></paper>

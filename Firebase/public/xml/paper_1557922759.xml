In delivering FISR service, SCADA system, Telco network and Power grid act as a whole heterogeneous network. While SCADA system and Telco network can be well represented by means of discrete event simulators. To represent a Power grid a continuous simulator is typically required. In the paper, to compute QoS of FISR, SCADA system, Telco network and Power grid have been represented by a unique model by means of a discrete event simulator.</abstract></paper>

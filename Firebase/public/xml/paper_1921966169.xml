We have recently (July and August 1978) achieved error-free or nearly error-free decoding results with several different acoustic processors on sentences from the New Raleigh Language (vocabulary 250 words, perplexity 7.27 words). One of these processors, which achieved a 0% error rate on New Raleigh sentences, has been used to decode sentences from the New Raleigh Language without the benefit of syntactic guidance during the decoding process. On this much more difficult task, it has achieved an error rate of 8.8% at the word level, corresponding to a sentence error rate of 53%. All of these processors are non-segmenting processors which produce output once every 10ms.</abstract></paper>

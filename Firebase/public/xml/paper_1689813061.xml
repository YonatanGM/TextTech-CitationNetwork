The first extension increases the capabilities of the method, by extending one of its key rules. The second, more important one, defines a new method for simultaneous search of refutations and models for set of equational clauses. The essential properties of the new method are given. The main theoretical result of the paper is the characterization of conditions assuring that models can be built. Both methods (for equational and non equational clauses) have been implemented as an extension of OTTER. Several running examples are given, in particular a new automatic solution of the ternary algebra problem first solved by Winker.</abstract></paper>

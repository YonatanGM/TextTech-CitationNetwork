Lean principles and agile methods address this need and have been successfully applied to software development. This paper shows how lean development and agile values can be applied to workflow management, as workflow modeling has strong similarities to software development. The required adaptability is enabled by the integration of workflow management and conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) and is implemented by the research prototype CBRFlow.</abstract></paper>

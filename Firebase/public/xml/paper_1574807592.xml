It also examines the justification for their use under different conditions. The six approaches are merged with Gorry and Scott Mortonu0027s [10] MIS framework and Simonu0027s [23] classes of decision making to create a contingency model for MIS contingency model :[54],"provides for MIS design leadership to be dependent upon type of decision making.

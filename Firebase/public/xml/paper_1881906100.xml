For a large class of systems including infinite state systems, the abstractions of the components can be obtained by replacing all operators on concrete domains by abstract operators on some abstract domain. This holds also for the abstraction of the control part of the system as we consider a kind of guarded command programs where all the control is expressed in terms of operations on explicit control variables.</abstract></paper>

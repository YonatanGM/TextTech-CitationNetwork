In particular, it is unclear whether end-users are really capable of adjusting a particular plan to execute a business process when using a declarative approach. Our paper addresses this knowledge gap by describing the design, execution, and results of a controlled experiment in which varying levels of constraints are imposed on the way a group of subjects can execute a process. The results suggest that our subjects can effectively deal with increased levels of constraints when relying on a declarative approach. This outcome supports the viability of this approach, justifying its further development and application.</abstract></paper>

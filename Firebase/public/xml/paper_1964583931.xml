We consider this for two conceptions of logic-based diagnosis, namely abductive and consistency-based diagnosis. We show how to represent diagnostic problems that can be conceptualised causally in each of the frameworks, and show that both representations of the same problems give the same answers. This is a local transformation that allows for an expressive (albeit propositional) language for giving the constraints on what symptoms and causes can coexist, including non-strict causation. This non-strict causation can be represented in each frameworkwithout adding special reasoning constructs to either framework. This is presented as a starting point for a study of the representation problem in diagnosis, rather than as an end in itself.</abstract></paper>

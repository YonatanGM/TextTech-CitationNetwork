A recent survey of data processing and word processing managers indicates that productivity improvement is indeed a motivating factor, but that operations control may not be particularly important. This implies that justification of office automation based on the need to enhance data processing and word processing control may be an insufficient reason for incurring the time and expense necessary to automate. Therefore, if productivity problems do not exist, operations control should be closely examined before citing it as a major reason for implementing office information systems.</abstract></paper>

Nevertheless, their symbiosis in the form of graph rewriting systems or graph grammars are not yet popular among software engineers. This is a consequence of the fact that graph grammar tools were not available until recently and of the lack of knowledge about how to use graph grammars for software development purposes. “Graph grammar engineering” is a first attempt to establish a new graph and rule centered methodology for the development of information system components. Having its roots in the late 80u0027s it gradually evolved from a “paper and pencil” specification formalism to a tool-assisted specification and rapid prototyping approach.</abstract></paper>

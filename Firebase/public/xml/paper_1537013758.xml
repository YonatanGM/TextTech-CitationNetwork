It also discusses the current status of this field. The chapter emphasizes on the development of MIS thought, the body of knowledge that exists through the performance of research, and the evolution of support mechanisms. MIS essentially deals with all informational and decision-making activity associated with operating an organization. In functional context, management information-decision systems are a blend of organizational theory, accounting, statistics, mathematical modeling, and economics, together with exposure to advanced computer hardware and software systems. This field is centered on expanding the horizons and integrating the decisions of organizations, both public and private, that must operate within the dynamics and functional demands imposed by their organizational size and degree of complexity. The chapter considers a historical approach that emphasizes on the academic and professional development of the MIS area. Decision support for management is very important to MIS.</abstract></paper>

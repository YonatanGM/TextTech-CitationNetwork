The calculus is an extension of Milneru0027s CCS with explicit time. In SCCS, :[24,66],"image in new :[28],"that if P exists at time r, it will proceed to Q at time r + 1. The time delay is exactly one unit. We extend this idea to asynchronous agents by allowing arbitrary delays. We write :[24,66],"image in new :[70],"mean :[28],"that aftert units of time, P will become Q, where e stands for idling. Based on the notion of bisimulation, two equivalence relations over agents are defined. It has been shown :[28],"that the strong equivalence is a congruence and the weak one is preserved by all operators except summation and recursion [W90]. Various examples are given to illustrate the approach.</abstract></paper>

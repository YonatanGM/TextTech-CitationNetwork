The goal of the work was twofold: to formally specify the FRP-DT using the timed-automaton formalism, and to analyze its behavior using the tool KRONOS. The work has revealed some unexpected behaviors of the design such as a timeout that never expires, and transitions that never occur, and more important potential problems such as inconsistency in the bandwidth reserved along the connection path.</abstract></paper>

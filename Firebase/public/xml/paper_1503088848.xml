It presents a view of negation by failure as a modal provability notion. Negation by failure is a central notion in Logic Programming and is used extensively in practice. There are various attempts at its foundations each with its own difficulties and limitations. We would like to present the modal point of view which, as far as we can see, resolves the main problems. The modal point of view also makes the connection with the notion of Modal Provability, which is a well known, well established area of pure logic. The results were first published in Gabbay 1986 and presented in Logic Colloquium 86.</abstract></paper>

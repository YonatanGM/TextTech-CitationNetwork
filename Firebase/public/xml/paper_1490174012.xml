An equivalent variation of the algorithm that allows a much cleaner, easier and algebraically more organized approach to the algorithm’s process is described. A further modification to the algorithm which yields specific performance improvements is given. Analysis of these methods is made through probability distributions which are appropriately selected to model the heuristic’s performance. The significance of the algorithm is addressed by further comparing these methods to a procedure in which movement between iterations is governed by a random process rather than by a directed criterion.</abstract></paper>

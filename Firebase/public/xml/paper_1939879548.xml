Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed collaborative tools and method to support groups during these meetings. The paper discusses meeting methods to support such meetings. A process is described that orchestrates the work in a way that gives non analyst participants an ordered set of tasks that they can complete. Use of this approach with a group data modeling tool provides a means for larger groups to effectively participate during data model development and review. Users can see and contribute model content in parallel. The approach manages complexity, supports comprehension, and fosters agreement among participants.</abstract></paper>

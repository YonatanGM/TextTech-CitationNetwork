If a cryptographic transformation is complete, then each ciphertext bit must depend on all of the plaintext bits. Thus, if it were possible to find the simplest Boolean expression for each ciphertext bit in terms of the plaintext bits, each of those expressions would have to contain all of the plaintext bits if the function was complete. Alternatively, if there is at least one pair of n-bit plaintext vectors X and Xi that differ only in bit i, and f(X) and f(Xi) differ at least in bit j for all :[110],"\{ (i,j)|1 \leqslant i,j \leqslant the function :[116],"f must be complete.</abstract></paper>

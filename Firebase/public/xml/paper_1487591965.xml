The result is an approach to deductive retrieval which appears to be feasible for data bases with very large extensions (i.e. specific facts) and comparatively small intensions (i.e. general facts). More specifically, a suitably designed theorem prover “sweeps through” the intensional data base, extracting all information relevant to a given query. This theorem prover never looks at the extensional data base. The end result of this sweep is a set of queries, each of which is extensionally evaluated. The union of answers returned from each of these queries is the set of answers to the original query.</abstract></paper>

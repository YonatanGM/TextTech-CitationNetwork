In this work we point out that there is a flawed step in the security reduction exhibited by the authors. Fortunately, it is possible to fix it without changing the scheme or the underlying the :[50],"second place, we introduce a variant of the seminal IBE scheme which allows a more efficient security reduction. This variant is simpler, and has more compact ciphertexts than Boneh-Franklinâ€™s proposal, while keeping the computational we :[86],"observe that the flawed step pointed out here is present in several works, and that our techniques can be applied to obtain tighter reductions for previous relevant schemes.</abstract></paper>

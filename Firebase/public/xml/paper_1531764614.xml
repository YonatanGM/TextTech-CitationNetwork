In a group oriented society, public keys are needed for communications between one organization and another. The organization might also want the supervisors to read some of the messages received by the employees. In the case of urgent messages, the organization may want any member to be able to read it [3]. This paper proposes a method in which individuals at separate organizations can communicate without the advance coordination of keys between the individuals. Thus, reducing the number of keys needed to communicate between two organizations. Also, the destination company can create its own policy on who can read messages and the type of public, or conventional, key system used within organization, without any involvement with the sending organization. This system will solve one of the many problems presented in [3].</abstract></paper>

In this paper, we proposed a g-CSI model that has two major contributions to overcome the weakness of the existing CSI models that not suitable for the e-government. First, the g-CSI model that measures customer satisfaction for government should have a difference in that for private sectors, and the e-government operates on the Internet environment. We suggest the g-CSI model for e-government suitable to the Internet environment. Next, using a feature weighting and a feature positioning, we can extract the improvement points to enhance the level of customer satisfaction.</abstract></paper>

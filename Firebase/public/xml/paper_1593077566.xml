Two approaches to such a formalization are first considered. In the first approach the elementary facts as well as the general statements are considered as the proper axioms of a first order theory, whereas in the second one the elementary facts are considered as defining an interpretation of a first order theory whose proper axioms are the sole general statements. These two approaches are discussed and contrasted with regard to the representation of negative information, querying and integrity checking. Both of them impose a uniform use of general statements; so, a third approach, which is an extension of the second one, is proposed. It enables one to use some general statements as derivation rules while others are used as integrity rules. Finally, due to their importance in relational data bases, some results specific to functional and multivalued dependency statements are stated.</abstract></paper>

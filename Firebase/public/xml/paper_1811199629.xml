Its full integration in a browsing environment reduces the learning effort and gives the language high flexibility making it suitable for users with different skill. The query formulation is accomplished by interacting with query forms, where the user can access the properties of objects in order to define conditions on them. The language has been integrated in the user interface of the KIWIS system, and further enriched with advanced features developed using some facilities of KIWIS. In particular, the user can formulate queries incrementally, and interact uniformally with both default and tailored object representations. u003e</abstract></paper>

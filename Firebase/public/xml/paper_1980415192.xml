Philosophical problems about the use of “intuition” in reasoning are related, via a concept of anlogical representation, to problems in the simulation of perception, problem-solving and the generation of useful sets of possibilities in considering how to act. The requirements for intelligent decision-making proposed by McCarthy and Hayes are criticised as too narrow, and more general requirements are suggested instead.</abstract></paper>

This paper outlines three scenarios in the application domains of data mining, regulatory applications and concurrent engineering that have been defined by potential users in the “real world.” The scenarios, or application vignettes, are illustrated using a new Deductive Object-Oriented Database (DOOD) language that has been developed at Bull. It is called Datalog Extended Language (DEL), and it contains features that make it especially well-suited to the application domains that we discuss. The scenarios described here seem to be representative of a large number of problems in many different application domains.</abstract></paper>

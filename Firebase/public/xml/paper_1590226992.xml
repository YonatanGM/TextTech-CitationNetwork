However, the known fail-stap signatures require very long keys, and they are quite inefficient, because messages are signed bit-wise. This paper presents a fail-stop signature scheme, in which signing a message block requires two modular multiplications and verification requires less than two modular exponentiations. Furthermore a construction is shown of an undeniable signature scheme, which is unconditionally secure for the signer, and which allows the signer to convert undeniable signatures into fail-stop signatures. This is the first published undeniable signature having this property.</abstract></paper>

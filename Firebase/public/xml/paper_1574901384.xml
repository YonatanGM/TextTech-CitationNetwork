Resources, such as databases, labor, etc. are typically required to process these tasks. Prerequisite to the execution of a task is a set of constraints that reflect the applicable business rules and user :[56],"this paper we present a Petri Net (PN) based framework that (1) facilitates specification of workflow applications, (2) serves as a powerful tool for modeling the system under study at a conceptual level, (3) allows for a smooth transition from the conceptual level to a testbed implementation and (4) enables the analysis, simulation and validation of the system under study before proceeding to implementation. Specifically, we consider three categories of task dependencies: control flow, value and external :[134],"identify several structural properties of PN and demonstrate their use for conducting the following type of analyses: (1) :[134],"identify inconsistent dependency specifications among tasks; (2) test for workflow safety, i.e. test whether the workflow terminates in an acceptable state; (3) for a given starting time, test whether it is feasible to execute a workflow with the specified temporal constraints. We also provide an implementation for conducting the above analyses.</abstract></paper>

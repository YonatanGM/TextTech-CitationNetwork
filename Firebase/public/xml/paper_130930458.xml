We are forming a community of networked, wearable-computer users to explore, over a long period, the augmented realities that these systems can provide. By adapting its behavior to the useru0027s changing environment, a body-worn computer can assist the user more intelligently, consistently, and continuously than a desktop system. A text-based augmented reality, the Remembrance Agent, is presented to illustrate this approach. Video cameras are used both to warp the visual input mediated reality and to sense the useru0027s world for graphical overlay. With a camera, the computer could track the useru0027s finger to act as the systemu0027s mouse; perform face recognition; and detect passive objects to overlay 2.5D and 3D graphics onto the real world. Additional apparatus such as audio systems, infrared beacons for sensing location, and biosensors for learning about the weareru0027s affect are described. With the use of input from these interface devices and sensors, a long-term goal of this project is to model the useru0027s actions, anticipate his or her needs, and perform a seamless interaction between the virtual and physical environments.</abstract></paper>

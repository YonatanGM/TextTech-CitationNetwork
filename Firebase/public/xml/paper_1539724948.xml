In the research community, product derivation methodologies are rather scarce, however. By studying product derivation, we believe we will be better able to provide and validate industrially practicable solutions for application engineering. In this paper, we present a framework of terminology and concepts regarding product derivation that serves as basis for further discussion. We exemplify this framework with two industrial case studies, i.e. Thales Nederland B.V. and Robert Bosch GmbH.</abstract></paper>

Our data structure requires O(log n) time per operation when the time is amortized over a sequence of operations. Using our data structure, we obtain new fast algorithms for the following problems: (1) Computing deepest common ancestors. (2) Solving various network flow problems including finding maximum flows, blocking flows, and acyclic flows. (3) Computing certain kinds of constrained minimum spanning trees. (4) Implementing the network simplex algorithm for the transshipment problem. Our most significant application is (2); we obtain an O(mn log n)-time algorithm to find a maximum flow in a network of n vertices and m edges, beating by a factor of log n the fastest algorithm previously known for sparse graphs.</abstract></paper>

Three issues in process management and modeling are identified: business orientation, traceability, and flexibility. It is shown how these issues can be addressed by basing process models on business models, where a business model focuses on the transfer of value between agents. As a bridge between business models and process models, the notion of activity dependency model is introduced, which identifies, classifies, and relates activities needed for executing and coordinating value transfers.</abstract></paper>

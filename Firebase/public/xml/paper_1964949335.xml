V.</publisher><abstract>Measurement of the value of computing in very small businesses has been largely ignored in the MIS literature. This article develops a comprehensive model for examining the satisfaction of small business users with information technology (SBUSIT). It is argued that current models are not applicable as they are targeted primarily towards either the traditional data processing or end-user computing environment. This study develops and statistically validates the SBUSIT model. The validated model and an accompanying instrument are provided. It is noteworthy that many new factors and specific items distinguish the model from current ones.</abstract></paper>

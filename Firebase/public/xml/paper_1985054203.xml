In this study, an objective method based on a Citation Analysis was employed to re-examine the quality of four established European IS journals as compared to 11 other well-recognized IS journals. Extensive citation data were collected to derive eight indices as the measures of journal quality. Our research results indicate that the quality of the four leading European IS journals is quite comparable to that of other well-known IS journals reported in prior studies.</abstract></paper>

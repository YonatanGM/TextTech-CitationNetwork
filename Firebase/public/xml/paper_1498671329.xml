Besides elementary tools like differentiation, various methods for finding the minimum of a convex function constitute the main body of nonlinear optimization. But even linear programming may be viewed as the optimization of very special (linear) objective functions over very special convex domains (polyhedra). There are several reasons for this popularity of convex functions: functions :[63],"occur in many mathematical models in economy, engineering, and other sciencies. Convexity is a very natural property of various functions and domains occuring in such models; quite often the only non-trivial property which can be stated in general.</abstract></paper>

The operators in the algebra of graphs proposed in this paper are quite different from those in the original term representation, making such notions as connection and correspondence of communication ports explicit. We show how basic elements of process calculi such as agents, reduction, and behavioural equivalences are soundly formulated in the new setting. The work is based on the authorsu0027 study on concurrent combinators [9, 10], and can be considered as offering another mathematical representation of the formal notion studied therein.</abstract></paper>

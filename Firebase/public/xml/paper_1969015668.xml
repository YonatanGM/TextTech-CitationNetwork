Many techniques have been proposed for the task of finding the component gaussians given samples from the mixture, such as the EM algorithm , a local-search heuristic from Dempster, Laird and Rubin~(1977). However, such heuristics are known to require time exponential in the dimension (i.e., number of variables) in the worst case, even when the number of components is $2$. This paper presents the first algorithm that provably learns the component gaussians in time that is polynomial in the dimension. The gaussians may have arbitrary shape provided they satisfy a “nondegeneracy” condition, which requires their high-probability regions to be not “too close” together.</abstract></paper>

IIDA is an ex. ample of a class of computer systems which serve as intermediaries, enabling their users to perform a complex task on another computer, and which are coming to be known as expert systems. The system was designed to encourage end users of information retrieval systems to perform their own searches by (1) instructing them in how to search, using computer‚Äêassisted instruction, and (2) assisting with the performance of the search by providing diagnostic analyses of the usersu0027 performance as well as answering their questions about how to use system commands. The systemu0027s design is described, as well as the various tests of its performance and the evaluation of test results. The conclusion is drawn that end users can become successful searchers through such an assistant, for the kinds of searches tested.</abstract></paper>

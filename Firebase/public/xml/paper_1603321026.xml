The algorithm improves both on an addition chain and an addition formula in the scalar multiplication. Our addition chain requires no table look-up (or a very small number of pre-computed points) and a prominent property is that it can be implemented in parallel. The computing time for n-bit scalar multiplication is one ECDBL + (n - 1) ECADDs in the parallel case and (n - 1) ECDBLs + (n - 1) ECADDs in the single case. We also propose faster addition formulas which only use the x-coordinates of the points. By combination of our addition chain and addition formulas, we establish a faster scalar multiplication resistant against the SCA in both single and parallel computation. The improvement of our scalar multiplications over the previous method is about 37% for two processors and 5.7% for a single processor. Our scalar multiplication is suitable for the implementation on smart cards.</abstract></paper>

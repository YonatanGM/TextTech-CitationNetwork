The investigation was triggered by the hypothesis that, with the possible exception of the least mature processes, software processes are multi-agent, multi-level, multi-loop feedback systems that must be managed as such to achieve sustained process improvement. This paper summarises some of the findings of the FEAST projects to date with emphasis on the process modelling methodology that were adopted and that have evolved over the duration of the two projects. Such procedures encompass both metric based black-box and white-box (system dynamics) behavioural modelling. It will also draw attention to the practical industrial application of the results obtained in the form of over thirty-five rules and guidelines for software evolution planning and management.</abstract></paper>

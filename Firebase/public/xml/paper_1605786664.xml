In particular, one in every 265 keys for 8.5-round IDEA is weak. A related-key differential-linear attack on 4-round IDEA is presented which is successful for all keys. Large weak key classes are found for 4.5- to 6.5-round and 8-round IDEA for which membership of these classes is tested using similar related-key differential-linear tests.</abstract></paper>

It has the disadvantage that its solution space, in general, includes additional integer unreachable or/and unfirable vectors. As a result, the analysis of properties using this linear characterization, usually leads to necessary or sufficient conditions for satisfying it, but not both. The appearance of these spurious solutions is due to the fact that the state equation does not take into account the order in which transitions fire.</abstract></paper>

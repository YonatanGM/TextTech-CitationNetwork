Its basic idea is to understand interpreted nested concept graphs as situation-based judgements in triadic power context families. With it, the logical th eory can be well developed and inferences can be characterized in three ways: By semantical entailment, by means of a standard model and by a sound and complete calculus.</abstract></paper>

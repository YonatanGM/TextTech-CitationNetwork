This is possible since Lesku0027s original algorithm (1986) is based on gloss overlaps which can be viewed as a measure of semantic relatedness. We evaluate a variety of measures of semantic relatedness when applied to word sense disambiguation by carrying out experiments using the English lexical sample data of SENSEVAL-2. We find that the gloss overlaps of Adapted Lesk and the semantic distance measure of Jiang and Conrath (1997) result in the highest accuracy.</abstract></paper>

It was reported that users sometimes feel anxiety because of low accuracy of the position estimation especially in urban area and delay of information updating. In order to reduce the anxiety, a route planning algorithm is proposed in this study, which weighs useru0027s difficulty (or easiness) of locating own current position as well as total physical distance of courses. The difficulty is estimated by valuation functions based on the "recognizability" and "visibility" of landmarks. An experimental study conducted in real situation using a prototype system to examine and refine the model for the optimal route planning. As the result, a modified model is proposed as a promising method of route planning for useru0027s easy wayfinding.</abstract></paper>

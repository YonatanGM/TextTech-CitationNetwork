A subset S′ of S is termed a k-set of S if it contains k points and there exists a straight line which has no point of S on it and separates S′ from S−S′. We let fk(n) denote the maximum number of k-sets which can be realized by a set of n points. This paper studies the asymptotic behaviour of fk(n) as this function has applications to a number of problems in computational geometry. A lower and an upper bound on fk(n) is established. Both are nontrivial and improve bounds known before. In particular, f k (n) = f n−k (n) = Ω(n log k) is shown by exhibiting special point-sets which realize that many k-sets. In addition, f k (n) = f n−k (n) = O(nk 1 2 ) is proved by the study of a combinatorial problem which is of interest in its own right.</abstract></paper>

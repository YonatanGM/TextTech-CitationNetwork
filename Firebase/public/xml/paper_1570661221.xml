In this paper we examine a class of problems derived from crossword puzzles that is difficult for the hill-climbing methods, yet is easily solved by standard forward-checking algorithms. The characteristic feature of this class is its hierarchical nature: clusters of dependent variables, with a small number of connections between the clusters. Although the results are experimental and not theoretical, we speculate that any hierarchical constraint-satisfaction problem with certain characteristics will be difficult for naive greedy algorithms.</abstract></paper>

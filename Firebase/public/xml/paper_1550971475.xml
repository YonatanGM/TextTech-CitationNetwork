For convenient location of the computer support, some meaningful intermediate whole should be defined between the individual and the organization. The concepts of u0027teamu0027 and u0027groupu0027 are intuitively understandable, but somewhat weak for serious :[52],"paper suggests that the concept of u0027activityu0027 from Activity Theory could fill the gap, and compares the properties of the activity concept with the needs of CSCW research. A classification of work support types based on the concept of activity, is produced in order to demonstrate its potential usefulness.</abstract></paper>

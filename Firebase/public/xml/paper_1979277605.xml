A prototype of the error localization assistant system which guides a programmer during debugging of Pascal programs is described. The system is interactive: it queries the programmer for the correctness of the program behavior and uses answers to focus the programmeru0027s attention on an erroneous part of the program (in particular, it can localize a faulty statement). The system differs from previous approaches in that it makes use of the knowledge of program structure, which is derived automatically. The knowledge of program structure is represented by the dependence network which is used by the error-locating reasoning mechanism to guide the construction, evaluation, and modification of hypothesis of possible causes of the error. Backtracking reasoning has been implemented in the reasoning mechanism. u003e</abstract></paper>

Reasons for modelling these processes, their chronological and hierarchical order, their interrelations and their deliverables at different levels of detail is to better understand their tasks and dependencies [Tul95]. We call a set of hierarchically structured process models, related via interfaces, a process landscape. Each activity of a process model belongs to the process landscape, but can also be refined by a landscape [GW00b] again. The predominant view onto process landscapes is a logical view, paying most attention to logical dependencies. We develop such a landscape by applying the Process Landscaping method [GW00a].</abstract></paper>

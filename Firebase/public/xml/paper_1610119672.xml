We focus on the situation when possible belief sets are built incrementally in stages. We call an infinite sequence of theories that represents such a process a reasoning trace. A set of reasoning traces describing all possible reasoning scenarios for the agent is called a reasoning frame. Default logic by Reiter is not powerful enough to represent reasoning frames. In the paper we introduce a generalization of default logic of Reiter by allowing infinite sets of justifications. We call this formalism infinitary default logic. In the main result of the paper we show that every reasoning frame can be represented by an infinitary default theory. A similar representability result for antichains of theories (belief frames) is also presented.</abstract></paper>

The KeeLoq algorithm has a 64-bit key and operates on 32-bit blocks. It is based on an NLFSR with a nonlinear feedback function of 5 :[49],"this paper new key recovery attacks on KeeLoq are proposed. The first one has a complexity of about 250.6KeeLoq encryptions. The second attack finds the key in 237encryptions and works for the whole key space. In our attacks we use the techniques of guess-and-determine, slide, and linear attacks as well as cycle structure analysis. Both attacks need 232known plaintext-ciphertext :[109],"also analyze the KeeLoq key management and authentication protocols applied in rolling-code and IFF access systems widely used in real-world applications. We demonstrate several practical vulnerabilities.</abstract></paper>

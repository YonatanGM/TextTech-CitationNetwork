Validating any selected single system is difficult because product line models are large and complex. However by modelling variability and dependency between requirements using propositional connectives a logical expression can be developed for the model and then selection validation can be achieved by satisfying the logical expression. This approach can be used to validate the model as a whole. A case study with nearly 800 requirements is presented and the computational aspects of the approach are discussed.</abstract></paper>

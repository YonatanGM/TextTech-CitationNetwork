The study attempts to relate critical success factors (CSF) of IS managers with performance of IS organizations. It has been concluded that all the performance measures identified in this study are significantly related to the CSFs of IS managers. Relations with and support of the objectives of the parent organization is most significantly related to performance, whereas DP operations is least significantly related to performance. On the other hand, improved user job performance is most significantly related to CSFs, whereas widespread use of IS is least related to CSFs.</abstract></paper>

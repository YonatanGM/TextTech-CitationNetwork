Two years later RIPEMD, a European proposal, was designed as a stronger mode of MD4. Recently we have found an attack against two of three rounds of RIPEMD. As we shall show in the present note, the methods developed to attack RIPEMD can be modified and supplemented such that it is possible to break the full MD4, while previously only partial attacks were known. An implementation of our attack allows to find collisions for MD4 in a few seconds on a PC. An example of a collision is given demonstrating that our attack is of practical relevance.</abstract></paper>

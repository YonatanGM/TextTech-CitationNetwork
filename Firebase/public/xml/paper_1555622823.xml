Many of these methods differ only on insignificant points and it is often difficult to deduce what the exact characteristics of the methods are before having tried them out in practice. All the more, there is a need for examining these characteristics and discussing fundamental aspects of object-oriented analysis and design. We believe that one such fundamental discussion is the handling of events in analysing the problem domain.</abstract></paper>

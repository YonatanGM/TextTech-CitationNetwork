To develop more and more complex systems efficiently, the trend is to intelligent infrastructure services. Since current interoperability solutions operate essentially at a syntactical level, technologies have to be developed enabling interoperability based on middleware, and development platforms have to be enriched with machine-understandable semantics. Our approach of â€˜Ontology-based Model Transformationu0027 will contribute to these challenges by lifting syntactical metamodel description into ontologies.</abstract></paper>

This paper presents a definition of spatial reasoning with a classification of spatial knowledge and describes several properties and needs of spatial reasoning. Two examples of applications concerning symbolic simulation and geographic information data management are surveyed. Object centered representation systems which are well adapted to spatial knowledge are presented.</abstract></paper>

Time management functionality should be provided to control the lifecycle of processes. Time management should address planning of workflow executions in time, provide various estimates about activity execution durations, avoid violations of deadlines assigned to activities and the entire process, and react to deadline violations when they occur. In this paper we describe how time information can be captured in the workflow definition, and we propose a technique for calculating internal activity deadlines with the goal to meet the overall deadlines during process execution.</abstract></paper>

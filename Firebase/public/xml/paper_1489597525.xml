However, it appears that this relationship frequently is threatened by ineffective systems work. It is caused by a set of perceptions and assumptions that users and analysts make which lead to dissatisfaction with the analyst. This article explores some of the reasons for failures and shortcomings as well as insights into what can be done to improve the situation.</abstract></paper>

It is an update of a previous article in CAIS (Volume 11, Article 16) that covered the period 1993-1997. All of the articles in seven mainstream MIS journals were examined in terms of subjects researched and methodologies employed to conduct research. Recent trends are presented and compared to those of the earlier study. The results clearly indicate the focus of efforts of researchers on information system usage and information systems resource management. The survey methodology still appeals to many researchers but increases in the use of mathematical models and laboratory experiments is an indication that the field is attaining maturity by using more rigorous research methods.</abstract></paper>

However, the current generation tools restrict their help to the management of the IS specifications. The goal of more advanced CASE tools is to support effectively designers during the design process itself and the production of the IS specification. The expert design tool OICSI, discussed in this paper, belongs to that perspective. The kernel of OICSI is a knowledge base homogeneously composed of design knowledge triplets. A triplet is a combination of a situation, a decision and an action. In order to define various triplets, we have experimented automatic learning techniques. The paper focuses on the presentation of the triplet notion and the use of learning techniques to find out triplets. Both are exemplified on a precise design task.</abstract></paper>

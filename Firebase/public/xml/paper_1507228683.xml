This paper is concerned with overlaps. It defines overlap relations in terms of specification interpretations, identifies properties of these relations which are derived from the proposed definition, shows how overlaps may affect the detection of inconsistencys shows how specifications could be rewritten to reflect overlap relations and still be amenable to consistency checking using theorem provings analyses various methods that have been proposed for identifying overlaps with respect to the proposed definitions and outlines directions for future research.</abstract></paper>

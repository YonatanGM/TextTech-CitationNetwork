As a consequence, organizations are forming online alliances in order to deliver integrated value-added services. However, due to the lack of methodologies and tools, the development of such composite service across organizations is usually ad-hoc and poses problems especially in the identification, composition and orchestration issues. In this paper, we propose a goal driven approach to understand the needs of different organizations for a new added-value composite service and to model the cooperative process supporting this service provision in a declarative, goal driven manner. The goal model called Map, is then used for service elicitation, distribution and orchestration. The paper presents the approach and illustrates it with an e-government cooperative service.</abstract></paper>

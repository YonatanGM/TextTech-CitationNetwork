From the point of view of a process, a methodology is a passive device which only specifies a set of steps and step transition constraints. A step of a methodology can be modelled in terms of the triplet, . A methodology is a collection of such triplets. The decisions of triplets articulate different kinds of methodology primitives like the creation, deletion, and modification of methodology-specific situations. Under this model, the development process becomes a decision making activity rooted in a methodology. The validation constraints of a methodology constrain this activity by regulating the transition from one decision to another.</abstract></paper>

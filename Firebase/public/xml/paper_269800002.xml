An equally important function of the system is to support communication within an organisation by structuring and co-ordinating the actions performed by the organisations agents. These two roles of a business system may be represented in terms of business and process models, i.e. the separation of the declarative aspects from the procedural control flow aspects of the system. Although this separation of concerns has many advantages, the differences in representation techniques and focus of the two model types constitutes a problem in itself.</abstract></paper>

However, it is not known whether the problem of breaking an RSA cryptosystem is equivalent in difficulty to factoring R. Rabin [3] has given a publik-key encryption method which is as difficult to break as it is to factor R, but the decryption process produces four possible candidates for the correct message and only one of these is the correct redundancy (e.g., a cryptographic key) there is no way for the sender to allow the recipient to identify the correct message being transmitted. Also, in [1] Lipton has pointed out some other weaknesses in the scheme when it is used as a cryptosystem. Indeed, Rabin only advocated its use as a signature system.</abstract></paper>

In an actor grammar, configurations of an actor system are represented by graphs, and the dynamic behavior of an actor system is described by graph rewriting. In this way, the problem of understanding the dynamic evolution of configurations in an actor system is translated into the problem of understanding the rewriting processes of an actor grammar. The structure of these rewriting processes is investigated by Janssens and Rozenberg (1989, 1990). The present paper continues the research on this topic; more precisely, it is demonstrated that the notion of a structured transformation, introduced by Janssens and Rozenberg (1989), arises in a natural way from the notion of a subcomputation, introduced by Janssens and Rozenberg (1990). All required notions about actor grammars are introduced in the paper.</abstract></paper>

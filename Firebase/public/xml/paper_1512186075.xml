He does not wish to perform, for each of the intended recipients, a separate encryption either of the secret or of a single key with which to protect the secret. A general method for such a secret broadcasting scheme is proposed. It is based on "k out of n" secret sharing. An example using polynomial interpolation is presented as well as a related vector formulation.</abstract></paper>

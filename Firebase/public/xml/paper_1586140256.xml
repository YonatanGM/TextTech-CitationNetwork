We propose a novel representation formalism, called simple regular expressions (SREs), for representing sets of states of protocols with lossy FIFO channels. We show that the class of languages representable by SREs is exactly the class of downward closed languages that arise in the analysis of such protocols. We give methods for (i) computing inclusion between SREs, (ii) an SRE representing the set of states reachable by executing a single transition in a system, and (iii) an SRE representing the set of states reachable by an arbitrary number of executions of a control loop of a program. All these operations are rather simple and can be carried out in polynomial time. With these techniques, one can construct a semi-algorithm which explores the set of reachable states of a protocol, in order to check various safety properties.</abstract></paper>

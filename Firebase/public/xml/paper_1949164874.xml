In particular, it remains secure under a "key cycle" usage, where we have a cycle of public/secret key-pairs (pk i ,sk i ) for i= 1,...,n, and we encrypt each sk i under ${\rm pk}_{(i \bmod n)+1}$. Such usage scenarios sometimes arise in key-management systems and in the context of anonymous credential systems. Also, security against key cycles plays a role when relating "axiomatic security" of protocols that use encryption to the "computational security" of concrete instantiations of these :[99],"existence of encryption systems that are secure in the presence of key cycles was wide open until now: on the one hand we had no constructions that provably meet this notion of security (except by relying on the random-oracle heuristic); on the other hand we had no examples of secure encryption systems that become demonstrably insecure in the presence of key-cycles of length greater than we :[165],"construct an encryption system that is circular-secure against chosen-plaintext attacks under the Decision Diffie-Hellman assumption (without relying on random oracles). Our proof of security holds even if the adversary obtains an encryption clique, that is, encryptions of sk i under pk j for all 1 ≤ i,j≤ n. We also :[165],"construct a circular counterexample: a one-way secure encryption scheme that breaks completely if an encryption cycle (of any size) is published.</abstract></paper>

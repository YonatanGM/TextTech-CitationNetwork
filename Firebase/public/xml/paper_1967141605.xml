The trace analysis shows that the average file system bandwidth needed per user is low (a few hundred bytes per second). Most of the files accessed are short, are open a short time, and are accessed sequentially. Most new information is deleted or overwritten within a few minutes of its creation. We wrote a simulator that uses the traces to predict the performance of caches for disk blocks. The moderate-sized caches used in UNIX reduce disk traffic by about 50%, but larger caches (several megabytes) can achieve much greater reductions, eliminating 90% or more of all disk traffic. With those large caches, large block sizes (16 kbytes or more) result in the fewest disk accesses.</abstract></paper>

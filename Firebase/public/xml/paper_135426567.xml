The class of standard automata is big enough to represent all f.a. representable sets /th.1/ but has many properties similar to special automata defined in [R1]. A standard regular expression is defined /def. 6/ describing a process of forming of an infinite tree, as well as a process of building of an automaton /analysis and synthesis theorems 3,4/. The standard regular expressions are a generalisation of McNaughtons formula v d :[126],"[N] /.</abstract></paper>

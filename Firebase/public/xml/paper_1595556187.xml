The study revealed that the most prevalent form of liaison is still the traditional systems representative and that the liaison function is generally performed much less formally than the IS literature would suggest. However, a trend toward greater formalism was detected. Other aspects of the liaison function, such as perceptions of the role, relevant career paths, and attitudes toward function were also studied.</abstract></paper>

At this level the user sees only the logical structure of the database that is relevant to his/her work. Both the relational and the entity-relationship model have proponents arguing that one data model is superior to the other when used in the end user environment. However, a literature review indicated that these arguments have not been based on empirical results from a systematic inquiry. The study reported here examined this issue through a controlled experiment using query writing as the task. Our basic assumption was that if one data model was superior to the other, then the superiority of the model would be reflected in the useru0027s query writing performance. In addition, this superiority would be demonstrated on both simple and complex tasks. Query writing performance was measured by three variables: number of syntax errors, number of semantic errors, and amount of time to complete queries. The results indicated that subjects using the relational model made fewer syntax errors, but required more time to complete a query. No significant differences in the number of semantic errors were found between the two data models. Based on these results, neither the relational nor the entity-relational data model was clearly superior when used as the interface between a database system and the end user. As expected, the more complex tasks caused more syntax and semantic errors, and required more time to complete.</abstract></paper>

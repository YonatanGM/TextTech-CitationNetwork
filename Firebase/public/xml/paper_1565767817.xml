However, the factors influencing that gap have not yet been fully explained and understood. This paper therefore investigates the real driving forces concerning the u0027demandu0027 side of egovernment and the take-up of public e-services. The paper summarises the findings of similar studies carried out in other countries and compares them with the results of the extensive study carried out in Slovenia during 2004 and 2006, with a focus on user expectations and satisfaction.</abstract></paper>

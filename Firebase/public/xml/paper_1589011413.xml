In this paper we challenge this approach and suggest the flexibly organised nature of work is better supported when systems provide a u0027mediumu0027 which can be tailored to suit each participantu0027s needs and organised around the detail of their work. This orientation towards u0027mediumu0027 rather than u0027mechanismu0027 has consequences for cooperative system design, highlighting a need to allow participants to adapt details of policy currently embedded in the heart of the systems we build We describe an approach which allows users to perform such u0027deep customisationu0027 through direct manipulation of user interface representations.</abstract></paper>

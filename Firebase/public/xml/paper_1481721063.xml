Since there are situations where the consideration of one context is not sufficient, it is desirable to introduce a formalization of a network of contexts. In this paper, such formalization is given by the notion of multicontext. The aim of the paper is to offer a first study of multicontexts and their conceptual structures; in particular, descriptions of conceptual coherences within the formalized network of contexts are presented. The theoretical considerations are illustrated by examples.</abstract></paper>

J. A. Kalmanu0027s original axiomatizations of the two calculi each contain five axioms. Three of Kalmanu0027s axioms (L1, L4, and L5) for the left group calculus were shown to be dependent on the remaining two axioms. Four of Kalmanu0027s axioms (R1, R3, R4, and R5) for the right group calculus were shown to be dependent on the remaining axiom. Alternative simpler axiomatizations were discovered for both calculi, including a single axiom for the left group calculus and five additional single axioms for the right group calculus. The program OTTER was vital in discovering candidate axiomatizations as well as in finding proofs of new axiomatizations. All of the relevant OTTER proofs are included.</abstract></paper>

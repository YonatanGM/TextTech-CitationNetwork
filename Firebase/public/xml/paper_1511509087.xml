The ARIS-House of Business Engineering encompasses the whole life-cycle range: from business process design to information technology deployment, leading to a completely new process-oriented software concept. At the same time, the architecture bridges the gap between business process modeling and workflow-driven applications, from Business Process Reengineering to Continuous Process Improvement.</abstract></paper>

The results were obtained from a 1985 opinion survey of MIS managers in over 100 St. Louis area companies. The most important issues fall into three categories: aligning MIS with corporate goals, software development, and end-user computing; the least important issues were narrowly focused or more technical. Comparison with prior research reveals that the alignment and end-user computing issues have increased in importance. The results indicate that MIS managers are more oriented to corporate than to technical issues.</abstract></paper>

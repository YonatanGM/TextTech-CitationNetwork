These rewriting processes are formally described by computation structures. It is demonstrated that the computation structures of an ESM system P may be viewed as the arrows of a category Cat comp(P) where objects are system states. This category generalizes the well-known notion of a transition system. From Cat comp(P) various more abstract semantics are derived, and for each of them a powerful composition operation on computations, generalizing both the sequential and parallel composition of computations, is defined.</abstract></paper>

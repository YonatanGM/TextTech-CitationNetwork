The classical solution to these problems, as found for instance in multiprocessor, multicache systems, is to restore a degree of interdependence between such units through a set of high speed interconnecting buses. This solution is not entirely satisfactory, as it tends to reduce the throughput of the memory hierarchy and to increase its cost.</abstract></paper>

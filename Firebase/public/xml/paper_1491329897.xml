The DADM (Deductively Augmented Data Management) system has been developed along several dimensions of utility and performance to provide a vehicle for research on interactive techniques for reasoning with data, answering questions, and supporting on-line decision making. After illustrating present system operation by means of several examples, new performance-enhancing features of the system are described. These features include improved user interfaces, improved visibility of processes and data structures, structure sharing, improvements in inference-planning mechanisms, methods for dealing with incomplete information, utilization of semantic advice, and means for controlling recursive premises.</abstract></paper>

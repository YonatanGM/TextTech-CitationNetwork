The two tools examined in the three learning experiments were the Logical Data Structure (LDS), which is based on the entity-relationship concept, and the Relational Data Model (RDM). For a series of trials, naive analysts were asked to generate data models using one of the tools. Feedback regarding the correct model was provided after each trial. The results suggest that when given structured tasks, novices are able to learn rather quickly how to produce small, good quality models using either of the tools. Comparatively, the LDS tool promoted significantly more top-down directed analysis and resulted in more accurate data models than the RDM tool. The significant differences are explained in terms of the visual appearance of the notation associated with the tools. The results have implications for data modeling training and for the development of data modeling tools.</abstract></paper>

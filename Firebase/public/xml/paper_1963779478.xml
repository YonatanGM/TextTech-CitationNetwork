Over 93 per cent of the word tags were correctly selected by using a matrix of tag pair probabilities and this figure was upgraded by a further 3 per cent by retagging problematic strings of words prior to disambiguation and by altering the probability weightings for sequences of three tags. The remaining 3 to 4 per cent were corrected by a human post-editor.The system was originally designed to run in batch mode over the corpus but we have recently modified procedures to run interactively for sample sentences typed in by a user at a terminal. We are currently extending the word tag set and improving the word tagging procedures to further reduce manual intervention. A similar probabilistic system is being developed for phrase and clause tagging.</abstract></paper>

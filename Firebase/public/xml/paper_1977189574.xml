Therefore, many authors were interested in this branch and studied this property on sets, cones, hulls and functions. In this paper, we study a modified concept called fuzzy convexity by introducing the notion of convex. M-convex and quasiconvex fuzzy sets, cones and hulls. Some of their relations and topological properties are presented.</abstract></paper>

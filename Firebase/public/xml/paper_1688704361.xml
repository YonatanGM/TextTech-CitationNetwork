The first set is designed for the situation where ground truth is available; while the second for the situation where ground truth is not available. Based on a test bank of more than 50 images for which ground truth is available, we computed both sets of evaluation measures and then correlated the two sets. Experimental results show that the first set of measures proposed agree with human (subjective) visual evaluation and the second set of measures correlates well with the first set, an indication of the usefulness of this set of measures in assessing the quality of image segmentation results even when ground truth is not available.</abstract></paper>

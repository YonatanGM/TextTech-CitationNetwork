The process complexity is exponential in the degree of the equations. Fast algebraic attacks were introduced [5] as a way of reducing run-time complexity by reducing the degree of the system of equations. Previous reports on fast algebraic attacks [1,5] have underestimated the complexity of substituting the keystream into the system of equations, which in some cases dominates the attack. We also show how the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [4] can be applied to decrease the complexity of the substitution step. Finally, it is shown that all functions of degree d satisfy a common, function-independent linear combination that may be used in the pre-computation step of the fast algebraic attack. An explicit factorization of the corresponding characteristic polynomial yields the fastest known method for performing the pre-computation step.</abstract></paper>

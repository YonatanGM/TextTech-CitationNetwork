The mathematical models for these relationships included only variables that describe the software characteristics and related environmental factors. This paper presents the hypothesis that software cost estimating relationships must include the effects of resources consumed in one life cycle phase on other phases. Such a model is difficult to validate, primarily due to the need for larger quantities of data of greater precision than is usually available. However, a preliminary result obtained from existing data is positive. Therefore, additional research is justified.</abstract></paper>

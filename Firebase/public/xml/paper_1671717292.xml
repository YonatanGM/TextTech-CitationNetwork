One of the most critical components in such stores is the awareness mechanism, used to notify clients of inserted, deleted or changed objects. In this paper we survey the various awareness schemes (including snapshot, timestamp and log based), describing them all as variations of a single unified scheme. This makes it possible to understand their relative differences and strengths. In particular we focus on a signature-based awareness scheme that we believe is especially well suited for digital libraries, and show enhancements to improve its performance.</abstract></paper>

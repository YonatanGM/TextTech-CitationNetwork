A certain incompleteness of such rules indicates some inherent gap between partial correctness of loop programs and its provability by strongly formal proof rules. Introducing the concept of infinite proof rules (i.e. rules with infinitely many premises) for loops, this paper is devoted to get some insight into this gap. Such rules provide proof-theoretical completeness and -- relevant for practice -- a general framework in which the invariant method is contained as a special case essentially corresponding to some "direct" mathematical induction over the infinitely many premises, but which opens also the view for other proof methods. As an example, a method of generalized invariants is described within this formal setting. As illustrated by examples, for certain programs generalized invariants may be "simpler" than classical invariants.</abstract></paper>

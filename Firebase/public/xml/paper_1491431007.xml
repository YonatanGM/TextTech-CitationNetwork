One of the main themes in the area of DLs has been to identify DLs that are both very expressive and decidable. This issue can be profitably addressed by relying on a correspondence between DLs and propositional dynamic logics (PDLs). In this paper, we exploit the correspondence as a framework to investigate the decidability and the complexity of a powerful DL, in which functional restrictions on both atomic roles and their inverse are expressible. We then show that such DL is suitable to represent n-ary relations, as needed in the applications of class-based formalisms to databases. The PDL that we use in this work is a proper extension of Converse Deterministic PDL, and its decidability and complexity is established contextually.</abstract></paper>

The relatively low cost of groupware reduces high-level visibility, but some argue that social dynamics will force mandated use-the large system approach. Interview studies of recently adopted on-line meeting schedulers in two large organizations found successful, near-universal use achieved without managerial mandate. Versatile functionality and ease of use associated with discretionary products appeared to be factors leading to adoption Other factors included organization-wide infrastructure and substantial peer pressure that developed over time.</abstract></paper>

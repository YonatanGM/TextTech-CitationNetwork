LAR is an extension of predicate logic by additional concepts which are to formalize our "natural" reasoning about algorithms. Semantically, this extension introduces an underlying "time scale" on which formulas are considered and "time shifting" connectives. Besides a full model-theoretic treatment, a consistent and complete formal system for LAR is given. The pure logical system can serve as a basis for various theories. As an example, a theory of "while program schemes" is developed which contains Hoareu0027s correctness proof system.</abstract></paper>

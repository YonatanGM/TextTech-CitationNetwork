We develop a methodology based on the microeconomic theory of production and apply the model to data from the banking industry. In addition, we compare our methodology to approaches based on key ratios of information technology deployment. Both procedures are applied to the same set of data. The results show that reasoning about information technology value based on key ratios may be misleading, especially when the figures are only calculated for a cross-section of data.</abstract></paper>

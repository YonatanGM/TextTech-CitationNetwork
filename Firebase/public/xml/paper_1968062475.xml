Access to this data base is made through a high level language, which is extended to permit data manipulation and to provide data views for different applications. The authorization model includes: 1) the explicit introduction of the concept of application into the definition of user rights; and 2) the use of predicates that can depend on any data in the system to control access at the data field level. Enforcement of authorization is distributed along time (mostly at compile time), and uses the view mechanism to make evident the application program data requests, which are checked by a centralized procedure that consults the access matrix. The system is shown to provide comprehensive authorization, including implementation of levels and compartments, special access restrictions, content-dependent, context-dependent and functional access.</abstract></paper>

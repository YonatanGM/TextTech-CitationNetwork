We then show that if, using an MA-protocol, P can prove to V in weakly zero-knowledge, that he possesses a solution to some hard problem, then this implies the existence of a bit commitment scheme. If the original protocol is (almost) perfect zero-knowledge, then the resulting commitments are secure against an infinitely powerful receiver.Finally, we also show a similar result for a restricted class of non-MA protocols.</abstract></paper>

Complementarily, while Use Cases are one of the most popular techniques for eliciting requirements in the design of Information Systems, Business Goals and Business Rules associate with Business Process Use Cases to compose a Business Model base structure. However, methods for relating Business Processes, Goals and Rules (PGR) are scarce, dissonant or highly analyst-dependent. In this sense, we propose a two-step method to help in guiding the elicitation of Business Goals and Rules from Process-level Use Cases, and their mapping to a Business Model representation. As a result, a solution Business Model generated by aligning the resulting trios (PGR) with a Business Model Canvas is presented to the organization stakeholders for review, validation and further negotiation.</abstract></paper>

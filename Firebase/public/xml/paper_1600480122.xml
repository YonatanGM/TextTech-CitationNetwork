Modeling variability is one of the most important tasks during the analysis phase. Domain analysis and requirements elicitation will bring up a huge amount of requirements and dependencies between product characteristics. Feature modeling is one approach to deal with complexity in expressing several requirements in features and structure them hierarchically in feature diagrams. Unfortunately the requirements and feature models become very complex as well. An adequate tool support is needed to manage the feature models and to support the linkage to requirements. Our research group has developed a prototype of a requirements engineering tool that supports the requirements engineering process for software product lines.</abstract></paper>

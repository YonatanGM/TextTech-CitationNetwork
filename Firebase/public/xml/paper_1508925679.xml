Artists, publishers and any other individual or business that has a commercial interest in preventing illegal copies of their work are in need of a way to achieve this. There are commercial techniques available on the Internet (like Steganos) and other techniques that are being researched. A desirable watermark is undetectable and can always be recovered. The ability to be recoverable is of concern, since if the watermark is easily destroyed it is useless. This paper investigates three known steganographic algorithms with respect to their robustness against four image processing operations: filtering, bitplane removal, DCT compression, and quantization. It is found that those steganographic algorithms often fail to recover the watermarks after the four image processing operations are performed.</abstract></paper>

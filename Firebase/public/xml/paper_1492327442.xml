Research in federated information systems has so far mainly addressed integration of object structure or if based on behavior representation, assumed identity of the lower level operations to be integrated. Based on earlier work that showed how a fine differentiation between the possible semantic correspondences could be used to improve the classification process, in this paper we examine business processes from the perspective of a prospective integration tool or designer and likewise provide a classification of different types of similarities between the activities in a process. From this classification, we develop a set of options for integration of business processes and, going to a more detailed level, present the set of choices available depending on particular types of correspondences between the activities of the processes that are to be integrated.</abstract></paper>

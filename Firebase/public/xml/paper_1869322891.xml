Many are centered on the notion of discovering services at run time and on allowing any system component to act as a service provider. The result is a growing reliance on the service registration and discovery mechanisms. This paper addresses the issue of facilitating such service provision capabilities in the presence of (logical and physical) mobility exhibited by applications executing over ad hoc networks. The solution being discussed entails a new kind of service model, which we were able to build as an adaptation layer on top of an existing coordination middleware, LIME (Linda in a Mobile Environment).</abstract></paper>

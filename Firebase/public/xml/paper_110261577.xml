The perceived lack of relevance has its roots in institutional factors. I argue that the current environment offers a great opportunity to influence these institutional factors in the direction of greater incentives for relevant research. I recommend that: 1) Current candidates in the IS faculty market should include relevance as a factor in deciding which position to take, and 2) IS researchers should use the Internet to package and promote their research to develop a constituency outside their academic institutions.</abstract></paper>
